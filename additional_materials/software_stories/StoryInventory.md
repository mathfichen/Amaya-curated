* Subtitle:

*  XX/XX/1996
   *  Date title: Amaya original logo
   *  Description: The original name of the editor/browser was Tamaya. A tamaya is a tree, as represented on the logo. It was chosen as a name because such a tree was present in the team’s office. The team members thought the tree could style both the image of the Net and the structure of a Web page. Unfortunately, they were not allowed to keep using the name since it was used as as trade mark by a French company. They decided to drop the first letter (T) and the browser became Amaya

## Timeline moment

*DESIDERATA*

Here are the dates of the first and last versions of the codes:

* PER: 13/2/68, 15/2/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* LETT: 13/2/68, 21/3/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* Exec: 5/3/68
* Exec: 5/3/68 (with output)
* Exec: 4/4/68
* Exec: 29/3/68
* SW_NAME-1: no date
* SW_NAME-2: 13/2/68, 5/3/68
* SW_NAME-3: 9/3/68, 4/4/68

*Question: I used inception P571 to indicate the initial date of the time span of the creation of SW_NAME. How do I enter the final date of the time span? I see that Kat has used P2669 discontinued date). I'm afraid both properties do not convey the intended meaning, that is the time span covered by our findings, which is likely shorter than the time span of the project.*

*Question: we might also put here the dates when they were saved in SWH. Again, do we need a new property?*
