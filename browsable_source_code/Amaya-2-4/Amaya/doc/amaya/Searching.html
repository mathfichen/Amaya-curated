<h2><a name="L1042">Searching and replacing text</a></h2>

<p>You can search and replace text with the <strong>Search</strong> dialog
box. Call this box by choosing <strong>Find</strong> from the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu, click on the corresponding button <img
src="../Icons/find.gif" alt="find ">, or use the keyboard shortcut
(control-shift-% in Unix, control-f in Windows)</p>

<p>This form allows you to search or replace text using different
criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The character string to be searched for must be entered in the
    <strong>Search for</strong> input area.</li>
  <li>If the <strong>UPPER=lower</strong> button is selected, a
    case-insensitive search is performed; otherwise, the string is searched
    for as it appears within the "Search for" input area.</li>
  <li>Strings can also be replaced using the same operation. The replacement
    text is entered in the <strong>Replace by</strong> input area and a
    replacement mode is selected from the <strong>Replace</strong> menu. The
    replacement modes are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No replace</strong>: no replacement occurs even if the
        ``Replace by'' input area contains a character string. It is just a
        simple search.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace on request</strong>: when the string is found, it is
        selected. The user can then select one of the following buttons:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Confirm</strong> to replace and carry out the search
            again.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not replace</strong> to search for the next instance
            without replacing the string which has been found.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Automatic replace</strong>: all instances of the string
        searched for are automatically replaced within the portion of document
        defined in the "Search where" menu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Search where</strong> menu allows you to specify the part of
    document in which the search occurs:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before selection</strong>: the search starts at the
        beginning of the selected part and moves backwards to the beginning of
        the document.</li>
      <li><strong>Within selection</strong>: the search only occurs within the
        selected part, from its beginning to its end.</li>
      <li><strong>After selection</strong>: the search starts at the end of
        the selected part and moves forwards to the end of the document.</li>
      <li><strong>In the whole document</strong>: the search is carried out in
        the whole document from the beginning to the end regardless of which
        part is selected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To initiate the search operation, click on the <strong>Confirm</strong>
button at the bottom of the form. If the string searched for is found, it is
selected and the document is positioned so as to make this string visible; you
can then search for the next instance of this string by selecting the
<strong>Confirm</strong> button again. If the string is not found, the "Not
found" message appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the form.</p>

<p>Search or replace can be abandoned at any moment by clicking on the
<strong>Done</strong> button.</p>

<p><strong>New</strong>:  Replacement operations can now be undone with the
Undo function (in the Edit menu, or keyboard shortcut control-z).</p>
