<h2>Views</h2>

<p><strong>Amaya</strong> can present different <em>views</em> of a document
simultaneously.  Each view is displayed in a different window. This allows you
to clearly see what is happening when you edit complex documents. It is also
an aid for moving across a document. Six views are available:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Formatted view</dt>
    <dd>Here you see a similar view of the document to that provided in other
      popular graphical browsers. It is a dynamic, direct manipulation view,
      in the sense that, at all times, it displays the changes you are making
      to the document. This is in contrast to editors which only provide a
      series of static snapshots of the document.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Structure">Structure view</a></dt>
    <dd>This view shows the actual structure of the document being edited.
      Each element is represented by its tag name, followed by its attributes,
      on the same line. The elements it contains are represented underneath
      along a blue vertical line that shows the extent of the element. Parts
      displayed in black can be edited directly, by clicking and typing. Parts
      displayed in blue can be changed only by editing commands.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Alternate">Alternate view</a></dt>
    <dd>This view allows you to see how the document looks like when displayed
      by a text-only browser. It is useful for checking the accessibility of
      your documents.</dd>
  <dt>Links view</dt>
    <dd>This view shows all anchors in a document, but only the anchors and
      the elements they contain. You can focus on it when working on hypertext
      links.</dd>
  <dt>Table of Contents view</dt>
    <dd>This view displays all headings (<code>Hn</code> elements), but only
      those elements. If the document is well structured, it displays an
      overview of the document.</dd>
  <dt>Source view</dt>
    <dd>Here you see the actual source code of the document. You can use it to
      edit the syntax of your document.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can open and close any view at any time.</p>

<h3>Opening a view</h3>

<p>To open a view, choose the corresponding <strong>Show ...</strong> command
in the <strong>Views</strong> menu (only available in the Formatted view). The
<strong>Show ...</strong> commands from the <strong>Views</strong> menu can
also be used to raise the corresponding window when it is in the
background.</p>

<h3>Closing a view</h3>

<p>To close a view choose the <strong>Close view</strong>  (or simply
<strong>Close</strong> in the Source view) command from the
<strong>File</strong> menu of that view. In the Formatted view, the
<strong>Close</strong> command closes the whole document, i.e. all views
displaying the same document.</p>

<h3>Using views</h3>

<p>All views (except the Source view) are automatically <em>synchronized</em>:
whenever you select some character or element in one view, the other views of
the same document are automatically scrolled to show the same part of the
document.</p>

<p>You can edit the document in any view. For optimum responsiveness when
typing, the entered characters are displayed only in the view where you have
clicked. As soon as you activate a command or click somewhere, these
characters are also displayed in the other views.</p>

<p>The Source view behaves differently: you have to explicitly ask for
synchronization, using the <strong>Synchronize</strong> command from the
<strong>File</strong> menu. When you have made a series of edits in the Source
view, you have to enter the <strong>Synchronize</strong> command from that
view to update all other views of the document. Conversely, when you have made
changes in any other view, enter the <strong>Synchronize</strong> command from
the Formatted view to update the Source view.</p>

<p>Synchronizing a document will cause Amaya to attempt to revalidate it. If
markup errors have been introduced in the source view Amaya will attempt to
recover them as well as it can. Since it is not possible to save from the
source view any version that is saved will be made into correct HTML. You
should check the document in the Structure view or Formatted view after
editing in the source to ensure that synchronization has done what you
expected.</p>

<p>Whenever you <a href="Publishing.html#L1104">save</a> a document, locally
or remotely, from the Source view or from the Formatted view, a
synchronization occurs automatically: all views reflect the state of the
document at the time it is saved.</p>
