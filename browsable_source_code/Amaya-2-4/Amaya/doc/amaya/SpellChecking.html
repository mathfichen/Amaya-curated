<h2><a name="L1063">Spell checking</a></h2>

<p>Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker. This tool is invoked by the
<strong>Spell Check</strong> command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu. It
uses the <code>LANG</code> attribute to select the right dictionary. You can
associate this attribute with any element in a document, even with a single
word. Use the <strong>Language</strong> command in the <strong><a
href="Attributes.html#L1073">Attributes</a></strong> menu  for that
purpose.</p>

<p>When the user wants to register a new word, the spell checker creates or
updates  the "user's personal dictionary". By default, the "user's personal
dictionary" is $HOME/.thot.DIC, but the user can define another file. Before
starting Amaya, the user must set the  <code>parameter <a
href="Configure.html#Personnal">"EXTENDDICT="</a></code> in the registry file
($HOME/.thotrc file) to change the default name . Thus, the checker will use,
in addition to the dictionary specific to the language, this dictionary (in
read-write mode) to control all documents.&ensp;This dictionary is created and
automatically updated by the spelling checker when the commands ``Skip
(+dic)'' and ``Replace (+dic)'' are issued (see below).</p>

<p>The <strong>Spell Check</strong> command in <strong>Edit</strong> menu
displays a form which enables you to choose the correction parameters and to
interact with the checker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The maximum number of proposals is specified in the <strong>Number of
    proposal</strong>s area. This number can take any value between 1 and 10,
    the default value is 3. Once an error has been detected, any change made
    to this value immediately displays a new list of proposals.</li>
  <li>Several buttons in <strong>Ignore</strong> submenu allow you to ignore
    certain words: for example words that contain capital letters, digits,
    Roman numerals or special characters indicated in the list below. This
    list can be modified by the user.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Checking</strong> submenu, similar to that in the <strong><a
    href="Searching.html">Search</a></strong> form, allows you to specify the
    part of document on which the checker will work.</li>
  <li>The erroneous word is displayed in the area<strong> Spell
    checking....</strong> The list of proposals is displayed in the selector
    located below the incorrect word. By default, the first proposal of
    correction is selected. To select another proposal, simply click on it.
    The selected proposal is displayed below the selector. This proposal can
    be directly modified in the form. The correction is made once you have
    clicked on one of the buttons <strong>Replace and next</strong> or
    <strong>Replace (+dic)</strong>.</li>
  <li>The language in which the correction is made is specified in the top
    left corner of the form. To change the language, just apply an attribute
    Language to the text concerned by using the <a
    href="Attributes.html#Attributes"><strong>Attributes</strong></a> menu and
    restart the correction procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>To start the correction, click on the <strong>Skip and next</strong> button
bottom of the form. If an error has been found, the incorrect word is selected
and highlighted in the document. If no error has been detected, the "Not
found" message is displayed in the bottom right corner of the form.</p>

<p>The user can then use one of the buttons placed at the bottom of the form
to perform one of the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Done</strong>: the form disappears and checking is aborted.
    Previous corrections are not canceled.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip and next:</strong> the word considered incorrect is
    acceptable. No change is made in the text nor in the dictionaries. The
    checker searches for the next error.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip (+dic)</strong>: it is the same as ``Skip and next'' but
    the word considered incorrect is added to the spelling dictionary specific
    to the document, thus the checker will ignore any subsequent occurrence of
    this word.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace and next</strong>: the word considered as erroneous is
    replaced by the correct word (changed or modified by the user, see above)
    and the checker searches for the next error.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Replace (+dic)</strong>: it is the same as.<strong>Replace
    and next</strong>: except that the replacement word is added to the
    document dictionary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
