<h1 style="text-align : center">Cascading Style Sheet support in Amaya</h1>

<p>This document describes the current state of the <a
href="../../Style">Cascading Style Sheet</a> support in Amaya. The
implementation is based on the <a href="/TR/PR-CSS1">CSS2 proposal</a> . We
focused on providing as many features as possible while offering an
easy-to-use and learn interface. To make learning easy  we choose a "learn by
example" approach suitable for users not experienced with style sheets.</p>

<p>This document contains the following sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Section "<a href="#L392">Presentation</a>" gives a short overview of the
    CSS.</li>
  <li>Section  "<a href="#L393">Interface</a>" details the CSS specific areas
    of the Amaya interface.</li>
  <li>Section "<a href="#L394">Current State</a>" presents the CSS
    functionalities that are currently implemented.</li>
  <li>Section "<a href="#L395">What's lacking</a>" explains the main points to
    be improved or added.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="L392">Presentation</a></h3>

<p>CSS defines a syntax to describe presentation associated with elements as a
set of properties (like colors, fonts, etc.). Associated to properties, a
selector restricts the application of these rules to a set of elements
depending on their type (like H1, or LI), their context (like an EM in a H3)
or classes applied to an element. A set of rules defines which properties are
applied when more than one selector match a given element. While this is
relatively simple for someone accustomed to handling structured documents,
experience has shown that a new user may have difficulties modeling a document
as a structured entity. This might be a problem when trying to introduce the
CSS to a large audience.</p>

<p>Thus, the challenge is to build a tool simple enough so that inexperienced
people can use styles when creating HTML pages with Amaya, while retaining all
the possibilities of CSS. The interface was also designed to not hide the
underlying complexity of the document structure (Structure View) and of the
CSS language (CSS rules may be shown), in order to shorten the learning curve
to structured presentation design.</p>

<p>One of the strongest features of CSS is the cascading model. Presentation
rules can be fetched from different remote files, tied to the document or
associated to one specific element in a page. This allows sharing and reuse of
sets of rules while allowing specific presentation. It also allows  the use of
an user defined set of rules to accommodate his preferences. We tried to give
a complete and simple view of the cascading model, showing separately specific
presentation (Structure View), document specific rules (Structure View and CSS
dialog box) and all the set of rules associated to the external style sheets
referenced by the document. It is possible to manipulate rules in one style
sheet but also to move them from one style sheet to another, allowing a user
to take presentation rules from a remote server and apply them selectively to
his own pages, in the purpose of building a pool of presentation rules.</p>

<h3><a name="L393">User interface</a></h3>

<p>We first present the Style interface as provided by the current version of
Amaya:</p>

<p>The Amaya menu bar contains a <strong>Style</strong> menu containing all
the actions related to presentation and style manipulation. Entries in that
menu are ordered from the most specific to the most generic operations, except
the last two entries, which are not related to CSS, but to HTML
(<strong>Information type</strong> and <strong>Character
element</strong>).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three entries call dialog boxes that associate presentation with the
    currently selected elements:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Character Style</strong> allows one to select font
        attributes (size, style, family and underline)</li>
      <li><strong>Colors</strong> allows one to choose the  foreground and
        background colors from a palette.</li>
      <li><strong>Format</strong> allows one to set  alignment, indentation,
        justification and linespacing.</li>
      <li><strong>Background Image</strong> allows one to insert a background
        image and to select the repeat mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All modifications made with these dialog boxes can be viewed
    immediately in the WYSIWYG view and the Structure view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Two entries are related to classes:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Create Rule</strong> uses the style of the selected element
        to define a new class with the same style. A list of the existing
        classes is proposed, the type of the current element being the
        default. This is the first step toward defining CSS rules.
        Presentation is moved from the selected element to the document
        header, defining a new CSS rule. All elements of the new class take
        the new style.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply class</strong> uses one of the existing classes and
        applies it to the selected elements. These elements are then displayed
        with the style associated with class chosen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Style sheets</strong> entries give access to external and User's
    preference CSS style sheets:
    <ul>
      <li>The entry <strong>Link</strong> allows one to link a new CSS style
        sheet to the current document. One can directly click on the target
        style sheet if it is already displayed in a Amaya window. In other
        case the user should click in the current document to get a dialogue
        form and type the target style sheet URI. This command adds a link
        element into the document head.</li>
      <li>The entry <strong>Open</strong> allows one to open one of the
        external CSS style sheets applied to the current document.</li>
      <li>The entry <strong>Disable</strong> allows one to remove effects of
        one of the external CSS style sheets to the current document. This
        command doesn't affect the CSS link in the document.</li>
      <li>The entry <strong>Enable</strong> allows one to re-apply effects of
        one of the external CSS style sheets to the current document. This
        command doesn't affect the CSS link in the document.</li>
      <li>The entry <strong>Remove</strong> allows one to remove one of the
        external CSS style sheets. This command acts as the Disable command
        but in addition to that the element link which attaches the external
        CSS style sheet is removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The commands Open, Disable and Enable can be applied to the User's
    preference style sheet, but the commands Link and Remove concern only
    linked CSS style sheets. The following figure shows the list of CSS style
    sheets proposed for the command Open. If no CSS style sheet is currently
    applied to a document, a dialog box explains that there is "No CSS file
    available".</p>
    <p><img src="../Icons/css.gif" alt="css.gif"></p>
  </li>
  <li>By default Amaya prints documents with CSS. The @media is interpreted to
    select what style rules are applied by the  printing process  and what
    style rules are used on the screen only. Nevertheless the user can ask the
    Amaya printing to ignore  all CSS style sheets.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L394">Current State</a></h3>

<p>Here, we focus on what is currently supported from the CSS2 proposal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parsing:
    <ul>
      <li>all the basic:
        <ul>
          <li>grouping selectors in one rule</li>
          <li>grouping properties in one rule</li>
          <li>comments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>classes and pseudoclasses</li>
      <li>context sensitive selector</li>
      <li>standard units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cascading order should be fine but prorities and specificities are not
    managed yet..</li>
  <li>CSS properties: Everything should be parsed correctly, but the back-end
    may lack support for some attributes (see <a
    href="CSSStatus.html">CSSStatus</a> file for more details).
    <ul>
      <li>Text: text-align, text-decoration and text-indent.</li>
      <li>Fonts: Times, Helvetica and Courier are available, with various
        character style and a set of predefined size (from 6 to 60
      points).</li>
      <li>Border, padding box properties are not supported in this
      version.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The attribute MEDIA attached to CSS links is not interpreted.</li>
  <li>Page rules are not interpreted too.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is support for user's preference which can be provided in</p>

<p><tt><code>$(HOME)/.amaya/amaya.css</code></tt> (Unix) or
<code>Amaya\users\username\amaya.css</code> (Windows).</p>

<h3><a name="L395">What's lacking</a></h3>

<p>First, considering the current draft compliance, the main issues for full
CSS2 support are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The CSS2 formatting model for border and padding is not yet
  implemented.</li>
  <li>Pseudo elements are difficult to handle.</li>
  <li>The current implementation is a bit restrictive on fonts.</li>
  <li>Page  properties are not managed yet.</li>
</ul>
