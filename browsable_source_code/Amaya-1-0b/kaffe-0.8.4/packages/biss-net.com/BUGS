OS/2 byte aligns Windows (ChoiceWindows may have wrong widths). Dear IBM,
please set FCF_NOBYTEALIGN in the WinCreateStdWindow call to fix this

Motif (JDK) left upper Frame resize (via mouse) looses location (causing
popups and Choices to appear at wrong locations). Could be fixed like
it is done in display.c (in the biss.awt.kernel native layer for kaffe)

Windows keystrokes with 'alt' modifiers are not reported (by JDK 1.0.2) as
Java events (as a workaround, we use Ctrl+Shift as global hotkey modifier)

Uggly OS/2 bold fonts on some machines (e.g. Toshiba laptops). Dear IBM again,
if you read this, please add a workaround which maps Java fonts to OS/2
bitmap fonts (maybe something like it is done in font.c with non-standard
Java font names). I know it is not really your fault, but it can make a real
difference
