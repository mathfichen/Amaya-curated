FAQ for Cygnus Win32
====================

I don't in general to get into debugging installations of Cygnus's Win32
environment.  However a few problems come up often:

Failure to create temporary files during configuration
------------------------------------------------------

Often the configuration doesn't work correctly and reports the failure
to create odd files, usually with names like 921345.  This means you don't
have the expected temp. directory.  Make sure you have created 'c:\tmp'.
