  W3C Reference Library Position Statement
</H1>
<P>
The success of the Web has put very high demands on the efficiency and
reliability by which people can exchange information.
<A HREF="../Protocols/">HTTP</A> has been one of the main vehicles behind
the success and has changed significantly in the last six years to keep up
with the evolution. W3C is playing an active role in the design and development
of HTTP and an important part of this work is to test out new ideas and features
in real applications.
<P>
The purpose of libwww is to provide an environment for experimenting with
extensions and new features - most notably for HTTP but also for many other
parts of the Web. The focus of libwww is mostly client side applications
like robots and browsers but it can also be used as a basis for server and
proxy applications. Libwww is part of the <A HREF="../Areas.html">W3C
Architecture area</A> and contains reference code for HTTP clients and for
other Internet protocols such as FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers.
It has a rudimentary HTML parser which can only do the very basics but please
have a look at the <A HREF="../Amaya/">Amaya Web client</A> for a full-blown
HTML browser/editor application.
<H2>
  History
</H2>
<P>
Libwww has been part of the World Wide Web almost from the beginning. Tim
Berners-Lee designed and implemented the first version back in November 1992
in order to demonstrate the Web model. Many people have picked up the Library
and used it in a variety of contexts. Applications such as Lou Montulli's
Lynx character based client, Mosaic Web browser by Marc Andreesen and Eric
Bena, and the CERN server by Ari Luotonen were all based on later versions
of libwww. Later on, applications like the Arena browser by Dave Raggett
and H&aring;kon W. have been added to the list.
<H2>
  Current Status
</H2>
<P>
Libwww is freely available under W3C copyright for use by anyone. The
distribution package contains a set of example applications spanning from
very simple ones to more advanced ones like a robot, and a text based Web
client. It also has a DejaGNU test kit for testing libwww internals and a
high-level interface to Tcl.
<P>
With <I>version 5.0</I> of libwww which was released September 10 1996, the
status of libwww has changed from generic Web toolkit for writing applications
to playground for experimenting with HTTP. The reason for this is that the
need for a generic Web API written in basic C has changed and we are now
more focused on how to improve HTTP than to provide a generic Web API.

  Recent Accomplishments

<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="User/ReleaseNotes.html">Version 5.0</A> released September 10
  <DD>
    The focus for version 5.0 was to provide a set of higher level, application
    specific APIs for accessing the Web. The Library contains a significantly
    improved interface for easy access to the Web through a large set of functions
    specialized to perform certain Web operations like <CODE>PUT</CODE>,
    <CODE>POST</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, GET and <CODE>HEAD</CODE>. Libwww
    contains a full HTTP/1.1 compliant client implementation including persistent
    connections, two-way PUT, the host header and many other features.

    Web API Presentation at WWW5
  <DD>
    The libwww API was presented at the
    "<A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~eliens/WWW5/program.html">Programming the
    Web - a search for APIs</A>" workshop in connection with the
    <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW5/">5th World Wide Web
    conference</A> in Paris. The
    <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW5/">libwww position paper</A>
    presented at the workshop discusses &nbsp;the basic requirements of a generic
    Web API and the lessons learned from the development of the libwww API. The
    most important requirement that we see today is that the Web must move towards
    <I>language independent, formalized APIs.</I> Only by doing this can we ensure
    that the APIs can keep up with the Web explosion which does not show signs
    of slowing down. W3C sees the development of generic and open Web APIs as
    an essential part of building new generations of Web applications and takes
    an active role in focusing efforts towards this goal.

  What is the Next Step?
</H2>
<P>
With the release of version 5.0, libwww will not be released bi-annually
as for previous versions. Instead, libwww will be used for extensive
experimentation with new features in HTTP and for gathering data with new
protocols like W3Mux. &nbsp;We are also actively looking into how the experiences
from building the libwww API fits into the paradigm of
<A HREF="../MobileCode/">mobile code</A> being an important part of the Web
model. Especially, we are looking to integration between libwww and
<A HREF="ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A> and also
how we can integrate libwww with other languages such as Tcl and Java. For
a specific list of new features, please look at the
<A HREF="User/ToDo.html">Library work list</A> for libwww.
