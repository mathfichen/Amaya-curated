  Standard BEFORE and AFTER Filters

<P>
This module provides a set of default <B>BEFORE</B> and <B>AFTER</B> filters
that can be registered by the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net manager</A> to be
called before and after a request. All filters can be registered either to
be called <I>globally</I> (all requests) or <I>locally</I> (pr request basis).
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTFilter.c">HTFilter.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C Reference
Library</A>.

  BEFORE Filters
</H2>
<P>
This is a standard set of <B>BEFORE</B> filters which the application may
initialize. This can be done in an easy way using the function
<CODE>HTBeforeInit()</CODE> in the <A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization
interface</A>.
<H3>
  Proxy and Gateway BEFORE filter
</H3>
<P>
Checks for registerd proxy servers or gateways and sees whether this request
should be redirected to a proxy or a gateway. Proxies have higher priority
than gateways so we look for them first! For HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 we may
only send a full URL (including the host portion) to proxy servers. Therefore,
we tell the Library whether to use the full URL or the traditional HTTP one
without the host part.
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTProxyFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Rule Translation BEFORE Filter
</H3>
<P>
If we have a set of rules loaded (see the Rule manager) then check before
each request whether how that should be translated. The trick is that a parent
anchor has a "address" which is the part from the URL we used when we created
the anchor. However, it also have a "physical address" which is the place
we are actually going to look for the resource. Hence this filter translates
from the address to the physical address (if any translations are found)
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTRuleFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Memory Cache (History List) Validation BEFORE Filter
</H3>
<P>
Check if document is already loaded. The user can define whether the history
list should follow normal expiration or work as a traditional history list
where expired documents are not updated. We don't check for anything but
existence proof of a document associated with the anchor as the definition
is left to the application.
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTMemoryCacheFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Persistent Cache Validation BEFORE Filter
</H3>
<P>
Check the cache mode to see if we can use an already loaded version of this
document. If so and our copy is valid then we don't have to go out and get
it unless we are forced to
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTCacheFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Client side authentication BEFORE filter
</H3>
<P>
The filter generates the credentials required to access a document Getting
the credentials may involve asking the user in which case we use the methods
registered by the <A HREF="HTAlert.html">HTAlert module</A>
<PRE>    
extern HTNetBefore HTCredentialsFilter;
</PRE>
<H2>
  AFTER Filters
</H2>
<P>
Like <B>BEFORE</B> filters we provide a default set of typical <B>AFTER</B>
filters that may be initialized by the application. Again, an easy way of
doing this is to call the <CODE>HTAfterInit()</CODE> function in the
<A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization interface</A>.
<H3>
  Persistent Cache Update AFTER filter
</H3>
<P>
On our way out we catch the metainformation and stores it in our persistent
store. If we have a cache validation (a 304 response then we use the new
metainformation and merges it with the existing information already captured
in the cache.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTCacheUpdateFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Error and Information filter
</H3>
<P>
It checks the status code from a request and generates an error/information
message if required.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTInfoFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Redirection filter
</H3>
<P>
The redirection handler only handles redirections on the <CODE>GET</CODE>
or <CODE>HEAD</CODE> method (or any other safe method)
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTRedirectFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Proxy Redirection filter
</H3>
<P>
This filter handles a "<CODE>305 Use Proxy"</CODE> response and retries the
request through the proxy
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTUseProxyFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Client side authentication filter
</H3>
<P>
The client side authentication filter uses the user dialog messages registered
in the <A HREF="HTAlert.html">HTAlert module</A>. By default these are the
ones used by the line mode browser but you can just register something else.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTAuthFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Request Logging filter
</H3>
<P>
Default Logging filter using the log manager provided by the
<A HREF="HTLog.html">Log Manager</A>.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTLogFilter;
