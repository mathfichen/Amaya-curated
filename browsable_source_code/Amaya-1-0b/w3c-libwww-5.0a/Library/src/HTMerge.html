The <I>Merge</I> stream can be used to merge multiple streams into a single
target stream. The Merge stream does not prevent any of the streams from
writing and no ordering is imposed. The main feature is basically that the
free and abort methods can be called n times where n equals the number of
feeds that put data to the stream.
