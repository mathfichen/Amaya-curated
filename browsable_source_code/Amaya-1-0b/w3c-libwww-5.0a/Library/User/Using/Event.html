  The Event Manager
</H1>
<P>
The Event Manager defines any event manager to be used by libwww for handling
events. An <I>event</I> is not strictly defined as it is highly platform
dependent and hence out of scope for the Library. If you are using the libwww
pseudo threads on Unix then an event is when the&nbsp;<I>select()</I> system
call returns a notification on&nbsp;a socket descriptor, but it may as well
be an asynchronous event from the windows manager etc. If your application
is not using anything but traditional blocking sockets then you do not need
an event manager at all. In that case, libwww will block on any socket or
system call until the process can proceed.
<P>
The libwww interface to an event manager is very simple as it consists of
<B>registering</B> a <I>socket descriptor</I>, the <I>location</I> in the
program, and the <I>current state</I> when an operation (for example
<CODE>read</CODE>) would block. When the event manager at a later point in
time gets a notification that the socket has become ready, it can then call
libwww with the state saved from the registration and libwww can continue.
Second, libwww must be able to <B>unregister</B> a socket when it is not
anymore in a state where it can block. <I>Only</I> in case the application
wishes to use <I>non-blocking</I> sockets it should register methods for
handling the <B>registration</B> process as described below.
<P>
<B>Note</B>: The library <B>core</B> does <I>not</I> define any event manager
- it is considered part of the application. The library comes with a
<A HREF="../../src/HTEvntrg.html">default event manager</A> which can be
initiated using the function <CODE>HTEventInit()</CODE> in
<A HREF="../../src/HTInit.html">HTInit module</A>
<P>
If you are working on a MSWindows platform then you have the possibility
of using asynchronous socket management (<EM>proactive mode</EM>) instead
of typical Unix select based I/O (<EM>reactive mode</EM>). Please read the
<A HREF="../Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows documentation</A> for more details.
