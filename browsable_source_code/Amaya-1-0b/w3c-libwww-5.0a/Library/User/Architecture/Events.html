  Threads and Event Loops
</H1>
<P>
Libwww can be used in either a single threaded or a multi threaded environment.
The Event class defines any event manager to be used by libwww for handling
events. An <I>event</I> is not strictly defined as it is highly platform
dependent and hence out of scope for the Library. There is no default event
loop registered by libwww, but there is an example implementation using pseudo
threads (non-blocking sockets and interlaced I/O) but you can simply replace
this by registering your own event loop. If you are using the libwww pseudo
threads on Unix then an event is when the&nbsp;<I>select()</I> system call
returns a notification on&nbsp;a socket descriptor, but it may as well be
an asynchronous event from the windows manager etc. If your application is
not using anything but traditional blocking sockets then you do not need
an event manager at all. In that case, libwww will block on any socket or
system call until the process can proceed.
<P>
The libwww interface to an event manager is very simple as it consists of
<B>registering</B> a <I>socket descriptor</I>, the <I>location</I> in the
program, and the <I>current state</I> when an operation (for example
<CODE>read</CODE>) would block. When the event manager at a later point in
time gets a notification that the socket has become ready, it can then call
libwww with the state saved from the registration and libwww can continue.
Second, libwww must be able to <B>unregister</B> a socket when it is not
anymore in a state where it can block. <I>Only</I> in case the application
wishes to use <I>non-blocking</I> sockets it should register methods for
handling the <B>registration</B> process as described below.
<H3>
  Providing Call Back Functions
</H3>
<P>
The thread model in the Library is foreseen to work with real thread interfaces
but can also be used in a pseudo threaded environment. In the latter case,
libwww handles the creation and termination of its internal threads without
any interaction required by the application. The thread model is based on
call back functions of which at least one user event handler and a event
terminator must must be supplied by the application. However, the application
is free to register as many additional user event handlers as it wants.

    User Event Handlers
  <DD>
    An application can register a set of user event handlers to handle events
    on sockets defined by the application to contain actions taken by the user.
    This can for example be interrupting a request, start a new request, or scroll
    a page. However, this requires that the actual window manager supports
    redirection of event on sockets.
  <DT>
    Event Termination
  <DD>
    This function is called from libwww every time a request is terminated. It
    passes the result of the request so that the application can update the history
    list etc. depending on the result. From the Library's point of view there
    is little difference between a user event handler and this function, as it
    in both cases is a call back function.
  <DT>
    Timeout Handler
  <DD>
    When using pseudo threads, the <CODE>select()</CODE> function in the Library
    event loop is blocking even though the sockets are non-blocking. This means
    that if no actions are pending on any of the registered sockets then the
    application will block in the <CODE>select() </CODE>call. However, in order
    to avoid sockets hanging around forever, a timeout is provided so that hanging
    threads can be terminated.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="control">Returning from a Call Back Function</A>
</H3>
<P>
Often an event handler needs to return information about a change of state
as a result of an action executed by the handler, for example if a new request
is issued, a ongoing request is interrupted, the application is to terminated
etc. This information can be handed back to the Library using the return
values of the call back function.
<P>
There are several situations where a thread has to be killed before it has
terminated normally. The application indicates that a thread is to be
interrupted, for example if the user has requested the operation to stop,
by using a specific return value from one of the user event handlers. The
Library then kills the thread immediately and the result is returned to the
application.
