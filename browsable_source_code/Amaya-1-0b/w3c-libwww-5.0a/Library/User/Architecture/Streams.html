  Data Flow using Streams
</H1>
<P>
A <A HREF="../../src/HTStream.html">stream</A> is an object which accepts
sequences of characters. It is a destination of data which can be thought
of much like an output stream in C++ or an ANSI C-file stream for writing
data to a disk or another peripheral device. It can be anything that accepts
data, for example another stream, ANSI C-file stream, or even a black hole
which absorbs data without ever sending it out again. Streams are used to
transport data internally in the Library between the application, the network,
and the local file system. Streams can be cascaded into a stream chain by
directing the output of a stream which often is called the sink or target
into another stream. This means that the processing of data can be done as
the total effect of several cascaded streams.
<P>
Streams are both used to transport data from the application to the network
and vice verse which enables applications to send data objects to the remote
server which is a requirement for doing collaborative work using HTTP as
the transport carrier. The stream-based architecture allows the Library to
be event driven in the sense that data is put down a stream as it gets ready,
for example from the network, and any necessary actions then cascade off
this event. An event can also be data arriving from the application which
would be the case when an application is posting a data object to a remote
server.
<P>
Many stream modules have their own subclass definitions of either the generic
stream class or the structured class which we will describe below. These
definitions can be found in the individual stream modules.
<H2>
  The Generic Stream Class
</H2>
<P>
The generic stream class is a superclass of all other streams and it provides
a uniform interface to all stream objects regardless of what stream sub-class
they originate from. The generic stream class is defined with the following
set of methods.
<P>
<A NAME="Stream"><IMG SRC="Stream.gif" ALT="Stream" WIDTH="393" HEIGHT="102"

<P>
<H2>
  The Structured Stream Class
</H2>
<P>
A structured stream is a subclass of a stream, but instead of just accepting
data, it also accepts the SGML "begin element", "end element", and "put entity".
The conversion from a generic stream to a structured stream is done by the
SGML tokenizer which recognizes basic SGML mark up like "&lt;", "&gt;", entities
etc.
<P>
<A NAME="StrucStream"><IMG SRC="StrucStream.gif" ALT="Structured Stream"
    WIDTH="379" HEIGHT="130" BORDER="0"></A>
<P>
A structured stream therefore represents a structured document. The elements
and entities in the stream are referred to by numbers, rather than strings.
A DTD contains the mapping between element names and numbers, so each instance
of a structured stream is associated with a corresponding DTD. The only DTD
which is currently in the Library is an extended version of the HTML DTD
level 1, but current work is done to update this to comply with the emerging
HTML level 3 specification.
<P>
As for generic streams, it is not required that the stream actually has a
output - it can for example be a stream writing to a file where no output
is required.
<H2>
  Cascaded Streams
</H2>
<P>
Streams are often cascaded into a stream chain but before explaining why
a stream chain is a flexible construction for data transportation, let's
have a look at what kind of streams, the Library provides. The stream modules
be divided into groups depending on their behavior:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Protocol Streams
  <DD>
    Internal streams that parses or generates protocol specific information to
    communicate with remote servers.
  <DT>
    Converters
  <DD>
    Streams that can be used to convert data from one media type to another or
    create a data object and present it to the user.
  <DT>
    Presenters
  <DD>
    These are streams that save the data to a local file and calls an external
    program, for example a postscript viewer.
  <DT>
    I/O Streams
  <DD>
    Streams that can write data to a socket or an ANSI C FILE object. This can
    be used when redirecting a request to a local file of when saving a document
    in the cache
  <DT>
    Basic Streams
  <DD>
    A set of basic utility streams with no or little internal contents but required
    in order to cascade streams.
</DL>
<P>
The first four stream classes often fall into a natural order in a stream
chain which is indicated in the the figure below. Here two typical stream
pipes are shown for data flowing from the network to the application and
vise verse:

<P>
As a more specific example, the figure below shows how streams are cascaded
when data from a remote HTTP server is handled by the Library. In this case,
the stream chain is built as data arrives to the Library from the network:
The first stream can decide whether it is a 0.9 or a 1.0 response from the
first line in the response; The HTTP header parser stream can decide the
format of the body when the header part is parsed and so forth. In other
situations the stream chain can be setup before data arrives if the format
is known a priori to the data acquisition.

<P>
The ground symbol symbolizes that all data goes into a black hole where nothing
is radiated from. The two stream outputs going to the application from each
of the converters symbolizes that error information is separated from other
data objects. This allows the application to direct any body part in an error
message, for example from a <CODE>"401 Unauthorized"</CODE> HTTP status,
code to a separate "<B>debug</B>" window where it can be displayed without
affecting the current document view.
