  Libwww Quick Overview
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/WWWCore.html">libwww core</A> is the central part of
<A HREF="../">libwww</A>. By itself it doesn't do much - it is not capable
of accessing any local files, HTTP servers, &nbsp;or any other Internet service.
Also, it does not know about authentication, redirection, caching or any
other often used feature. The reason for this is&nbsp;that not all applications
need the same amount of functionality and also they do not need it to be
done in the same order. Therefore, in order to accommodate the various needs
of different types of applications, libwww has a set of application profiles
which initialize the libwww core with a standard set of features provided
as a part of the W3C Library distribution-file.
<H2>
  Application Profiles
</H2>
<P>
The Library comes with a large set of default functions, for example for
accessing HTTP and FTP servers, parsing
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</A> headers etc. but it must all be registered by the application before
the core knows about it. You can either register the parts directly through
the many initialization functions in the Initialization Interface or you
can use these "precompiled" profiles which are set up to contain the features
often used by the a specific type of application, for example a client and
a robot.
<H3>
  Client Profile
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTProf.html#Client">Client profile</A> initializes a
large set of features often used in client applications. These include features
like:
<UL>
  <LI>
    HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, Telnet Access , local file access and optionally
    WAIS access
  <LI>
    MIME parser
  <LI>
    Access authentication and Automatic redirection
  <LI>
    Rule file management, proxy server and gateway support
  <LI>
    Chunked Encoders and decoders
  <LI>
    Request Log Manager
  <LI>
    History Manager
</UL>
<H3>
  Robot Profile
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTProf.html#Robot">Robot profile</A> initializes a large
set of features often used in client applications. These include features
like:
<UL>
  <LI>
    HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, Telnet Access , local file access and optionally
    WAIS access
  <LI>
    MIME parser
  <LI>
    Access authentication and Automatic redirection
  <LI>
    Rule file management, proxy server and gateway support
  <LI>
    Chunked Encoders and decoders
  <LI>
    Request Log Manager
</UL>
<H2>
  Issuing a Request
</H2>
<P>
When you want to load a URL, or perform some other method, for example sending
a document to a remote server, you must create a Request object -fill it
out with your preferences, and pass it to the Library. In the application
interface, there is already a large set of functions that help you set up
the request in order to perform the operation you want. For example, there
are functions that download a document into a memory buffer, save a document
to local file, or to POST form data to&nbsp;a remote HTTP server.
<P>
When a request is passed to the Library, libwww calls a set of filters that
can modify the request in&nbsp;various ways before it is passed on to the
network layers of libwww. Also, after a request has terminated, libwww calls
a set of AFTER filters that interpret the result and can perform
variousoperations based on this result. If the request succeeds and we start
receiving data from the other end of the connection, the Library creates
a stream pipe which feeds data from the network layers back to
the&nbsp;application. In the request object you can specify the final destination
for your data, for example presenting it to a user, save it to a file, or
to send it over the network.
<H2>
  Filters
</H2>
<P>
Libwww has a concept of filters that can be called when a request object
has been passed to the Library and when the request has terminated.These
filters handle a lot of the functionality enabled by the application profiles.
For &nbsp;example, access authentication, redirection, logging,cache validation,
proxy support and much more are implemented as filters.Filters can be registered
either locally to a single request of globally for all requests. Global filters
is useful if the filter is to be performed very often and local filters can
either add to or override the global set of filters.
<P>
All filters are registered at run-time, and filters can be cascaded so that
one filter can call other filters and so on. Filters can also start new requests
or terminate existing requests, so the set of possibilities is very big.
Normally, filters do only handle metainformation about a resource.For example,
the authentication filters looks to see if we have been asked to provide
some&nbsp;credentials in order to access a URL. If so then it adds a protocol
defined header to the&nbsp;request, and if not&nbsp;then the request just
proceeds.
<H2>
  Streams
</H2>
<P>
One thing filters can not do is to add a document to the request- for example
if you are using a <TT>PUT</TT> method in order to send a document &nbsp;to
a remote HTTP server. Instead, the Library uses streams to transport data
objects from the application over the network, or&nbsp;the other way. Streams
are advantageous as they handle data as&nbsp;soon as it arrives and they
can be cascaded into stream pipes. Each stream element in a stream pipe can
do some operation on the data object. Streams can be used for many things:
they can convert data object from one data type to another, or they can apply
a compression algorithm or a transport encoding, for example base 64.
However,streams can also be used for calculating the content length, or to
generate an MD5 hash of the data object.
<P>
Stream pipes are generated by looking at the <I>content-type</I>, the<I>
content-encoding</I>, and the <I>transport-encoding</I> of a data object.That
is, if the Library receives a document encoded using chunked transfer-encoding,
then it looks to see if it has a stream object which can decode this encoding
and pass it to the next stream in the stream pipe.
<P>
Another feature of streams is that they can be forked into multiple streams
and then do different operations on each branch of the stream. This is for
example how we cache a document while we are presenting it to the user, or
you can also preserve the original HTML text in one branch while parsing
the document in another.
<H2>
  Request a URL
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/WWWApp.html">application interface</A> provides many
helper functions that make the Library core easier to use. This is particular
the case for accessing URLs where you can find a large set of functions in
the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A>. If these functions
for some reason are not what you are looking for then you can of course go
ahead and write your own additions but you should find what is needed at
least to get started!
<H2>
  Getting Started
</H2>
<P>
For a more detailed description of libwww, you can read the Architecture
document, the Library Interface overview describing the various modules of
libwww, and finally the User's Guide describing how to set up preferences
and lots of other stuff. There are also many example application as part
of the Library distribution file that you may have a look. These will often
help you understand how to use libwww in practice.
