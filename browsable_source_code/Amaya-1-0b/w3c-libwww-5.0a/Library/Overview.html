  Libwww - the W3C Reference Library
</H1>
<P>
The W3C Reference Library (libwww) is a general-purpose Web API written in
C. It is a highly modular extensible API which can be used as the code base
for writing Web clients, servers, proxies etc. The purpose of Libwww is to
provide a reference code for HTTP and other Internet protocols and also to
serve as a generic Web API. It has a rudimentary HTML parser which can only
do the very basics. Please have a look at the <A HREF="../Amaya/">Amaya Web
client</A> for a HTML browser/editor application and
<A HREF="../Jigsaw/">Jigsaw server</A> for a full-blown server application.

by John Mallory.

  User Documentation and Design Overview
</H2>
<P>
We have a huge amount of documentation about the design &nbsp;of libwww and
how to use it for building applications. Often, however, the easiest is to
study the example applications which show in practice how to do tricks with
libwww. We try to keep the documentation up to date but it may not always
be the case. The best thing is to have a look the list of exported functions.
This list is generated automatically and is always up to date.

  Mailing lists
</H2>
<P>
Libwww has the following set of mailing lists that you are more than welcome
to use! Before you send mail to the lists, please check out the archives
- they often contain good information about how to solve problems. Please
do not send mail directly to the authors - the mail load is already rather
high and you will most probably get a &nbsp;better response time by using
one of the following mailing lists.
