<h2>Editing the document structure</h2>

<h3><a name="L653">Changing element type</a></h3>

<p>To change the type of an existing element, select it and choose the new
type in the <strong>Types</strong> menu or by clicking on a button.  You can
thus change a numbered list into an itemized list, for example, or a paragraph
into a heading or a list. To remove a type that is selected from the
<strong>Style</strong> menu (<a href="HTML-elements/inline.html">inline
types</a> - those that can be a phrase in a paragraph or list use the relevant
option in the submenus of the <strong>Style</strong> menu as a toggle. Most
other types can be removed as a transformation of the element when it has been
selected (see below).<strong></strong></p>

<p>To select an entire element, place the insertion point anywhere within it
and press the <a href="Selecting.html#Selecting1">Esc (F2 on Windows)
key</a>.</p>

<p>More complex <a href="#L631">structure transformations</a> are also
possible.</p>

<h3><a name="L631">Changing the document structure</a></h3>

<p>Simple structure transformations can be achieved using the
<strong>Types</strong> menu (see <a href="#L653">above</a>). More complex
transformations can be obtained by other means.</p>

<h3><a name="L141">The <strong>Transform</strong> command</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Transform</strong> command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu
performs complex structure transformations. This command is based on a
structure transformation language that specifies how a given structural
pattern can be transformed into different structures.</p>

<p>The <strong>Transform</strong> command pops up a menu that lists all the
transformations that can be applied to the current selection. Just choose the
transformation you want.</p>

<p>The available transformations are defined in the file
<code>Amaya/amaya/HTML.trans</code>.  Please refer to the document <a
href="Transform.html">Use of the file HTML.trans</a> for a description of the
language in which the transformation rules are written.</p>

<p>Additional transformations may be specified in the <code>HTML.trans</code>
file. Some are provided as examples. For instance, it is possible to transform
nested lists into a table and conversely.</p>

<h3><a name="Inserting">Inserting a Division</a></h3>

<p>One can easily group a set of paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, etc.
within a division. To do that one has to select the elements to be grouped and
select the entry DIV in the menu type.</p>

<h3><a name="Back">The Back Space and Delete keys</a></h3>

<p>Successive elements can be merged, even if they are not at the same level
in the document structure. Merging is achieved with the Back Space and Delete
keys. When the insertion point is at the end of an element, use the Delete
key, when it is at the beginning, use the Back Space key. In both cases, these
keys do not delete any characters, but merge elements which are separated by a
structure boundary.</p>

<p>When the insertion point in within an element, these two keys delete the
next or previous character, as usual.</p>
