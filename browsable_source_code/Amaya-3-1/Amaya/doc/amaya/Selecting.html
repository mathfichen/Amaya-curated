<h2>Selecting</h2>

<p>Many commands in <strong>Amaya</strong> act on the current selection.  The
current selection can be changed in different ways.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Selecting with the mouse</dt>
    <dd>As usual, you can click with the left mouse button for moving the
      insertion point.
      <p>To select some text, drag a region - move the mouse with the left
      button pressed down and release it when the desired part is
      selected.</p>
      <p>You can also extend the selection by clicking with the left button
      combined with the Shift key.</p>
      <p>You can select a whole element, such as a list item by clicking on
      its bullet or its number.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Selecting with the arrow keys</dt>
    <dd>The four arrow keys on the keyboard move the insertion point in the
      four directions. If there is no visible selection in that document, up
      and down arrows allow you to scroll the document one line up or one line
      down.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Whatever the way you change the current selection, the type of the first
selected element is displayed at the bottom of the window. It is followed by
the types of the enclosing elements in the structure. This may be helpful when
the document structure is complex.</p>

<h3><a name="Selecting1">Selecting by Structure</a></h3>

<p>The structure view is especially convenient for quickly selecting large
elements. Just click on the blue label that represents the element, or on the
name of any of its attributes, or even on its blue vertical line. A large
element like a complex table or a long list can be selected with a single
click.</p>

<p>Clicking on a black character in the Structure view selects only that
character.</p>

<p>A bold text in the structure view represents the value of an attribute that
can be edited directly from the keyboard. A selection in such an attribute
value cannot be extended outside the attribute.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use the Keyboard for selecting by structure in any
view. Pressing the Esc (F2 on Windows) key selects the parent element in the
document structure. Pressing the Esc (F2 on Windows) key several times allows
you to select containers (and everything in them) up the structure the
structure towards the root. It is also possible to select child elements: the
default shortcut key is ctrl-minus ("-"). To select the next or previous
element at the same level (or at the level of the parent element if there is
no next/previous child of the current parent) use control-k (for next) and
control-j (for previous).</p>

<h3><a name="Selecting2">Selecting images</a></h3>

<p>If you click on the left hand part of an image, the insertion point is
moved to the left edge of that image. This allows you to type text before the
image. If you click on the right hand part of an image, the insertion point is
moved to the right side of that image. This allows you to type text after the
image.</p>

<p>When using the arrow keys to move, the cursor will move from one side of
the image to the image itself (selecting it)and then to the other side</p>

<p>If you want to select the whole image, click anywhere within the image and
move a bit with the button pressed down. Do not leave the image before
releasing the button. The whole image is then selected. You can use the copy,
cut and paste commands to move or duplicate the image element along with all
its attributes.</p>
