<div id="Assembling">
<h2><a name="L1065">Assembling large document collections</a></h2>

<p>Amaya allows you to handle document collections. Such a collection may, for
instance, represent a technical documentation constituted by several web
pages. One of these pages contains the title of the whole documentation (an
<code>H1</code> element), an introduction (some other elements), and a list
(<code>OL</code> or <code>UL</code>) whose items contain links to each
chapter. Chapters are separate documents which can also have the same type of
structure.</p>

<p>Such an organization is useful for browsing, but it has a number of
drawbacks when the whole documentation has to be printed.
<strong>Amaya</strong> addresses this problem with the "make book" function.
You just have to use typed links for linking chapters: associate a
<code>rel="chapter"</code> or <code>rel="subdocument</code>" attribute with
the anchor that refers to a chapter (select the <code>A</code> element and use
the <strong><a href="Attributes.html#L1073">Attributes</a></strong> menu).</p>

<p>Each referred chapter or  sub-document can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>either a whole external document,</li>
  <li>or just a subset of a larger external document.</li>
</ul>

<p>To refer to a document subset, the usual manner is to define a DIV element.
which delimits the part of the target document you want to include and to link
to this <a href="Links.html#target1">target element</a>.</p>

<p>Then, when activating the "make book" function, all blocks (<code>LI</code>
elements in the above example) containing a typed link to a chapter will be
replaced by the corresponding actual web pages (or web page subsets), and you
will get a unique document containing the whole collection:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>when the link refers to a web page, all the BODY content of the
    target document is included.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>if the link refers to a target element, this element with its content
    is included.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>if the link refers to a target anchor, the content of the anchor is
    included, but not the anchor itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before each replacement, the "make book" function generates a new DIV
element with an ID attribute. So each added pieces are clearly separated.</p>

<p>Previous pieces of the new generated document could contain normal links,
target anchors and target elements. During this operation, Amaya checks to
ensure that each NAME and ID attribute values remain unique in the new
document. If needed, Amaya changes these values and updates relative links. At
the same time, external  links are automatically updated when they referred an
external document or document subset which is now included. For example, if
the link pointed to a whole external document, this link will refer the DIV
enclosing element after the operation. So the new unique document containing
the whole collection is still coherent.</p>

<p>This large document can then be <a href="Numbering.html#L1064">numbered</a>
and <a href="Printing.html#L1062">printed</a> with a complete table of
contents and a list of all links.</p>

<p>To activate this tool, choose the <strong>Make Book</strong> item from the
<strong>Special</strong> menu.</p>
