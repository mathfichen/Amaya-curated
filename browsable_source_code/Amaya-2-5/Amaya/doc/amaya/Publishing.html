<h2><a name="L1052">Saving and Publishing documents</a></h2>

<p>Amaya allows you to save documents either in HTML or as text format.</p>

<p>Remote and local saving can be accessed in two ways, through the
<strong>Save</strong> and <strong>SaveAs</strong> commands.</p>

<p>This manual section deacribes the Publishing menu commands. In addtion,
there are a number of configuration options related to Amaya that you may
change through the <a href="Configure.html#Publishing">Configuration
menu</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="L1104">Saving documents in HTML</a></h3>

<p><b>Amaya</b> does not provide any global view of the set of pages installed
on a server. However it is possible to save files to a remote server as to
local files through the <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>SaveAs</strong>
commands. During these operations, Amaya takes images into account.</p>

<h4><a name="L1517">The Save command</a></h4>

<p>The save command can be invoked either by choosing <strong>Save</strong>
from the <strong>File</strong> menu (control-s in Windows, control-x,
control-s in Unix) or by clicking on the <img alt="floppy"
src="../Icons/floppy.gif" align="middle" border="0"> button. This command
saves the current document to the location it was fetched from. Newly added
images are saved in the same directory and no confirmation is asked except if
the document name is unknown. Servers allow users to fetch a document when
only the server name or the server directory name is given. This is very
useful at browsing time, but it is not supported by the put method. In this
case, Amaya detects that the document name is missing and proposes to use a
default name or to complete the request.</p>

<p>If one needs to save newly added images to a different location, the
<strong>Save As</strong> command should be used instead.</p>

<h4><a name="L1518">The Save As command</a></h4>

<p>Selecting the <strong>Save As</strong> entry in the <strong>File</strong>
menu opens a dialog box that allows you to save the current document to a
different location, a remote Web server or the local file system. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>save the document to a local disk,</li>
  <li>save the document to a remote URI,</li>
  <li>save images embedded in the document in the document directory or a
    different location,</li>
  <li>transform embedded URIs,</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../Icons/SaveAs.gif" alt="SaveAs"></p>

<p>The items in the dialog box, from top to bottom, left to right are used as
follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Document directories</strong> selector shows the directories
    contained in the current directory. It should be used to save a file on
    the local file system.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Files</strong> selector shows the files contained in the
    current local directory.</li>
  <li>The <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>XML</strong> and
    <strong>Text</strong> toggles are exclusive. The default is HTML and you
    have to change it, if you want to produce an XML (Voyager) or a text
    format of the current document.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Copy Images</strong> toggle indicates whether the images
    embedded in the current document must be copied along with the document to
    the new location. It's generally better to keep this switch on as
    otherwise you will not be sure that the corresponding images will be found
    when opening the document later. However switching it off is useful when
    you have only changed the text of the document and the document is stored
    on the same server. When images are copied, Amaya will automatically
    update all <strong>SRC</strong> attributes to point new image locations.
    New locations will be relative URIs.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Transform URIs</strong> toggle transforms all current URIs
    into relative URIs when it's possible. Of course, if the document is saved
    in a local file and URIs point to remote files, URIs will be absolute
    ones. This ensures that all the links in the document remain correct after
    the copy. However if you have several document linked together with
    relative URIs and that you plan to move them to a remote location,
    disabling URI conversion is needed to avoid referencing the initial
    locations.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Document location</strong> field indicates the location
    where the HTML file has to be written. This can be a file in the local
    filesystem (e.g. "/pub/html/welcome.html") or the name of a remote URI
    (e.g. "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Welcome.html").
    <p><strong>Note</strong> that this should be a complete path as there is
    no way to guess the name of "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW". You should also
    make sure that you have the <strong>right to do a PUT</strong> method in
    the case of a remote location. See the page on <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Put.html">configuring your server to
    accept the PUT method</a> or ask your Web administrator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Images location</strong> field allows you to save images (if
    <strong>Copy Images</strong> has been selected) to a different place than
    the HTML file. This field should contain the name of a directory in the
    local filesystem or a location in the remote server.
    <ul>
      <li>using a relative path, the images is stored at a location relative
        to the document directory. For example, if the document location is
        "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Welcome.html" and the images location is
        "Images", an image "W3C.png" contained in the document is stored at
        the URI "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Images/W3C.png" and the HTML file
        is modified to reference it as:
        <p>&lt;IMG SRC="Images/W3C.png"></p>
        <p>This is similar in the case of a document location in the local
        filesystem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>using an absolute path, the images are stored at this exact
        location, independently of the document location. In the previous
        example, if the images location specified is "http://pub/WWW/Images",
        the image is stored at "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Images/W3C.png" and
        the corresponding HTML file is modified in the following way:
        <p>&lt;IMG SRC="Images/W3C.png"></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking on <strong>OK</strong> starts the process of transforming the
    document and a popup asks for confirmation in both of the following cases:
    <ol>
      <li>The document has to be saved on a remote server. The complete URI to
        be written to is displayed for verification.</li>
      <li>The document has to be saved locally and the file already
      exists.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong> :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When saving to a remote location please check that the http_proxy is
        not set, or that the proxy server and the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Put.html">target server are
        configured to work with the PUT</a> method.</li>
      <li><p><b>Amaya</b> does not currently contact the remote server (in
        case of an "http://..." destination) to check whether such a document
        already exists.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L1105">Saving documents as text</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Save As</strong> command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu
displays a dialog box that allows you to save the current document in various
formats. Clicking the <strong>Text</strong> button from the <strong>Output
Format</strong> menu saves the document in text form, in a local file. A list
of all URIs used in the document is appended to that file.</p>
