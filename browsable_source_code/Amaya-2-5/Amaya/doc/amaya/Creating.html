<h3>Input method for ISO-Latin-1</h3>

<p>Some characters can be combined to provide  ISO-Latin-1 characters with a
standard (e.g. North American) keyboard.</p>

<p>The optional input method (Multi-Key) is based on a two key sequence
beginning with the "accent" followed by the "letter". For example to obtain a
'ã' first press '~' then type 'a'. To obtain a '~' you have to press '~'
twice. The table below lists all available key sequences:</p>

sequences">

<p>By default, this input method is disabled. It's possible to dynamically
enable and disable the multi-key input method by using  the menu <a
href="/local_home/vatton/Amaya/doc/amaya/Configure.html#General">Special->Preferences->General</a>.</p>

<p>To obtain a non-breakable space (&amp;nbsp;) with Amaya you have to hit the
Control key with the Space key.</p>

<h3>Buttons and <strong><a name="Types">Types</a></strong> menu</h3>

<p>The simplest way to create new elements in a document is to move the
insertion point to the desired position and to use the <strong>Types</strong>
menu or the buttons corresponding to the most common elements (image,
headings, lists, etc.). These buttons and menu items create the corresponding
element at the current position.</p>

<p>In some cases, the desired element cannot be created exactly at the
position chosen, because of the constraints imposed by the HTML DTD.
<strong>Amaya</strong> then tries to create the element at the closest
position where it is allowed.  For instance, if the insertion point is at the
end of the last line of a paragraph when you click on the <img
src="../Icons/H2.gif" alt="H2"> button, <strong>Amaya</strong> does not create
the new heading at that particular position (which would be invalid), but
after the paragraph (which is probably what you intended).</p>

<p>In some other cases, <strong>Amaya</strong> changes the existing structure
for creating the desired element. If the insertion point is somewhere within a
list item (<code>LI</code>) when you create a second level heading (for
example with the <img src="../Icons/H2.gif" alt="H2"> button, or from the
menu), the list item and its enclosing list are automatically split, in order
to create the requested heading at the chosen position and to comply with the
HTML DTD.</p>

<p>When creating new elements, it is important to select an <em>insertion
point</em>, not some text nor a single character: if the current selection is
not empty, <strong>Amaya</strong> tries to <a
href="Changing.html#L631"><em>transform</em></a> the selected part into the
element type chosen.</p>

<p>Some documentation of <a href="HTML-elements/infoTypes.html">how to use
element types</a> is available, as well as a briefly annotated <a
href="HTML.html">list of all the HTML 4.0 elements</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Structure">Structure menu</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="#Types"><strong>Types</strong> menu</a> allows you to create
only elements that are part of the document <code>BODY</code>. To create
elements in the document <code>HEAD</code>, use the <strong>Structure</strong>
menu from the <a href="Views.html#Structure">Structure view</a>. This menu
works in the same way as the <strong>Types</strong> menu: put the caret at the
desired position and choose the element type from the
<strong>Structure</strong> menu.</p>

<p>The <strong>Structure</strong> menu also allows you to create comments,
using its <strong>Comment</strong> entry. Comments are shown only in the <a
href="Views.html#Structure">Structure view</a>, but they can be inserted at
any position in the document.</p>

<h4>Generated elements</h4>

<p>Some HTML elements are constituted by several other elements of different
types. For instance, a table contains usually a caption (<code>CAPTION</code>)
and several rows (<code>TR</code>) and several cells (<code>TD</code> or
<code>TH</code>) in each row.</p>

<p>When <strong>Amaya</strong> creates such elements, it also creates their
components. A table is created with a caption and a row containing a single
cell. The insertion point is placed automatically in the first of these
components. You can enter the content of that component immediately or later.
You can move to the next (empty) component with the mouse or with the arrow
keys.</p>

<h3><a name="L906">The Enter (or Return) key</a></h3>

<p>When you are writing a new document or a new part in a document, you often
create elements sequentially. To do that, just press the Enter (or Return)
key. The current element is terminated and a new one is created just after.
This applies obviously to paragraphs, but also to other types of elements,
such as headings or <a href="Tables.html#Editing">table cells</a> for
instance.</p>

<p>Most often, the new element created is simply a paragraph, whatever the
type of the previous element. If you need another element type, you can
immediately change the type of that element, by selecting the desired type in
the <strong>Types</strong> menu or by clicking on the corresponding button,
but you can also keep typing and <a href="Changing.html#L653">change the
type</a> later.</p>

<h4>Multiple Enters at the end of an element</h4>

<p>When the insertion point is in an empty element, pressing the Enter key
<em>replaces</em> that element by another empty element at the next higher
level in the document structure. This feature allows you to create complex
nested structures very quickly.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first item in the highest level list.
    <p>A paragraph in the first item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The second item.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>First item in the nested list.</li>
      <li>Second item in the nested list.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Last item in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create that structure, create first a numbered list with a first item
(for example by clicking on the <img alt="Numbered List " border="0"
src="../Icons/NumList.gif" align="middle"> button) and type in the first line.
At the end of that first line, press the Enter key: it creates a new paragraph
in the item. At the end of this paragraph, press the Enter key: it creates yet
another paragraph, but pressing the same key again replaces that paragraph by
an empty item 2. At the end of the first line of item 2, create a new list
with its first item (for example click on the <img border="0" alt="Numbered
List " src="../Icons/NumList.gif" align="middle"> button). The new list will
automatically be nested.  Item b. is created by a double Enter at the end of
item a. When the insertion point is at the end of item b, create item 3 by
four successive Enters. To create the paragraph that follows these lists,
press Enter three times when the insertion point is at the end of item 3.</p>

<h4>Multiple Enters at the beginning of an element</h4>

<p>The Enter key works in the same way when the insertion point is at the
beginning of an element, but it creates new elements <em>before</em> the
current element.</p>

<p>For instance, you can add an initial paragraph in a list item by moving the
insertion point before the first character of that item and pressing Enter. If
you press Enter twice, you get a new item before the current item. This is
useful for inserting a new item before the first one.</p>

<p>This use of the Enter key does not apply only to lists and paragraphs, but
to all elements. It is for instance very convenient for <a
href="Manual.html">creating tables</a>.</p>

<h4>Exiting anchors or styled character strings</h4>

<p>When a paragraph or another block of text is styled - terminated by an
anchor or a character string in bold, italic or other such style - moving the
insertion point to the end and typing appends characters to the anchor or the
styled string. If you want to exit this styled element and enter plain text,
just press Enter and continue typing.</p>

<p>The same method can be used to enter plain text at the <em>beginning</em>
of a block starting with an anchor or styled characters.</p>

<h4><a name="Changing">Changing the document Title</a></h4>

<p>You can edit the document title (TITLE element) in the Title field of the
main window. When the new title is OK, you <span style="color :
#FF0000">must</span> validate it by pressing the Enter key. You can also edit
the document title in the <a href="Views.html#Structure">structure
view</a>.</p>
