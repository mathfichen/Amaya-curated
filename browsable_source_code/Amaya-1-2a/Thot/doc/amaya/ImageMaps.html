<h3>Using client-side image maps</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> allows you to use client-side image maps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
To activate an area in a map, double-click on the area with the left mouse
button. The URL attached to this area is then fetched. 
<li>
To display existing areas, choose <strong>Show Map Areas</strong> from the
<strong>Views</strong> menu. 
</ul>

<h3>Creating client-side image maps</h3>
<p>
To create a new image map, you must create the image element first, either by
choosing <strong>Image</strong> from the <strong>Types</strong> menu or by
clicking on the <img border="0" src="../Icons/Image.gif" align=middle> button. This
brings up a dialog box that lets you enter the file name of the desired
image.</p>
<p>
To create an area in a image, select the image or an existing area of that
image. Then choose <strong>Rectangle</strong>, <strong>Circle</strong>,
<strong>Polygon</strong> from the <strong>Area Map</strong> submenu of the
<strong>Types</strong> menu, depending on the shape of the new area you want
to create.</p>
<ul>
<li>
To create a rectangular or circular area, you must first select the position
of one corner by pressing the left mouse button. Keep the button pressed down
and move to the position of the opposite corner, then release the button. The
area is now defined. 
<li>
For a Polygon, enter each point by clicking the corresponding position with
the left mouse button. To indicate the last point, click with the middle
button. 
</ul>
<p>
When the area has been defined, you must enter the target of the link
associated with that area. Just click on the target (or enter its URL if it is
not displayed), in the same way as you <a href="Links.html#L245">create
links</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="L11711">Moving image map areas</a></h3>

When the area has been defined, you can move this area:</p>

allows you to move this area;</p>
<li><p>
Or by editing the <strong>coords</strong> attribute of the area in the
Structure View.</p>
</ul>

with the <strong>Middle</strong> or the <strong>Right button</strong> of the
mouse within an area of image map allows you to move this area;
