<h2>Views</h2>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> can present different <em>views</em> of a document
simultaneously.  Each view is displayed in a different window. This allows you
to clearly see what is happening when you edit complex documents. It is also
an help for moving across a document. Five views are available:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Formatted view</dt>
<dd>
Here you see a similar view of the document to that provided in other popular
graphical browsers. It is a dynamic, direct manipulation view, in the sense
that, at all times, it displays the changes you are making to the document.
This is in contrast to editors which only provide a series of static snapshots
of the document. 
</dd>
<dt><a name="Structure">Structure view</a></dt>
<dd>
This view shows the actual structure of the document being edited. Each
element is represented by its tag name, followed by its attributes, on the
same line. The elements it contains are represented underneath along a blue
vertical line that shows the extent of the element. 
<p>
Parts displayed in black can be edited directly, by clicking and typing. Parts
displayed in blue can be changed only by editing commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alternate view</dt>
<dd>
This view allows you to see how the document looks like when displayed by a
text-only browser. It is useful for checking the accessibility of your
documents. 
</dd>
<dt>Links view</dt>
<dd>
This view shows all anchors in a document, but only the anchors and the
elements they contain. 
</dd>
<dt>Table of Contents view</dt>
<dd>
This view displays all headings (<code>Hn</code> elements), but only those
elements. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
You can open and close any view at any time.</p>

<h3>Opening a view</h3>
<p>
To open a view, choose the corresponding <strong>Show</strong> command in the
<strong>Views</strong> menu (only available in the Formatted view).  The
<strong>Show</strong> commands from the <strong>Views</strong> menu can also
be used to raise the corresponding window when it is in the background.</p>

<h3>Closing a view</h3>
<p>
To close a view choose the <strong>Close View</strong> command from the
<strong>File</strong> menu of that view. This command is not available for the
Formatted view, but closing the document closes that view.</p>

<h3>Using views</h3>
<p>
All views are <em>synchronized</em>: whenever you select some character or
element in one view, the other views of the same document are automatically
scrolled to show the same part of the document.</p>
<p>
You can edit the document in any view. For optimum responsiveness when typing,
the entered characters are displayed only in the view where you have clicked.
As soon as you activate a command or click somewhere, these characters are
also displayed in the other views.</p>
