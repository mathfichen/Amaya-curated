<h2>Selecting</h2>
<p>
Many commands in <strong>Amaya</strong> act on the current selection.  The
current selection can be changed in different ways.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Selecting with the mouse</dt>
<dd>
As usual, you can click with the left mouse button for moving the insertion
point. 
<p>
To select some text, drag a region - move the mouse with the left button
pressed down and release it when the desired part is selected.</p>
<p>
You can also extend the selection by clicking with the middle button.</p>
<p>
You can select a whole element, such as a list item by clicking on its bullet
or its number.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Selecting with the arrow keys</dt>
<dd>
The four arrow keys on the keyboard move the insertion point in the four
directions. 
</dd>
<dt><a name="L894">Selecting with the Esc key</a></dt>
<dd>
This powerful shortcut may be used when something is selected or when the
insertion point is placed somewhere in the document. Pressing the Esc key
selects the <em>parent</em> element in the document structure. Hitting the Esc
key several times allows you to traverse the structure towards the root. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Whatever the way you change the current selection, the type of the first
selected element is displayed at the bottom of the window. It is followed by
the types of the enclosing elements in the structure. This may be helpful when
the document structure is complex.</p>

<h3>Selecting in the Structure view</h3>
<p>
The structure view is especially convenient for quickly selecting large
elements. Just click on the blue label that represents the element, or on the
name of any of its attributes, or even on its blue vertical line. A large
element like a complex table or a long list can be selected with a single
click.</p>
<p>
Clicking on a black character in the Structure view selects only that
character.</p>
<p>
A bold text in the structure view represents the value of an attribute that
can be edited directly from the keyboard. A selection in such an attribute
value cannot be extended outside the attribute.</p>

<h3>Selecting images</h3>
<p>
If you click on the left hand part of an image, the insertion point is moved
to the left edge of that image. This allows you to type text before the
image.</p>
<p>
If you click on the the right hand part of an image, the insertion point is
moved to the right side of that image. This allows you to type text after the
image.</p>
<p>
If you want to select the whole image, click anywhere within the image and
move a bit with the button pressed down. Do not leave the image before
releasing the button. The whole image is then selected. You can use the copy,
cut and paste commands to move or duplicate the image element along with all
its attributes.</p>
