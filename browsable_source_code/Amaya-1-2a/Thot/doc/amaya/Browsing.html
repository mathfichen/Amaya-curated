<h2>Browsing with Amaya</h2>
<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> behaves like many other Web browsers, except for
activating links and displaying anchors.</p>

<h3><a name="L311">Activating a link</a></h3>
<p>
Links are usually displayed in blue (or underlined on monochrome displays and
on paper). As <strong>Amaya</strong> is an editor, a single click just moves
the insertion point. Thus, to activate a link, you must <em>double click</em>
on it.</p>
<p>
The document retrieved by this operation normally <em>replaces</em> the
current document in the same window. However, if the current document has been
modified and has not been saved yet, another window is created for the new
document, to avoid the loss of last changes.</p>

<h3><a name="L515">Target anchors</a></h3>
<p>
Some pieces of text are displayed in green, even if no particular style is
specified. These elements are <em>target anchors</em>, i.e. anchors with a
<code>name</code> attribute that identifies the element as a possible target
for a link. The color green is intended to make the creation of links easier.
As you can quickly recognize the possible target of a link, you can <a
href="Links.html#L245">create links</a> faster.</p>

<h3>Opening documents</h3>
<p>
You can open local or remote documents in several different ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Open commands from File menu</dt>
<dd>
Two commands, <strong>Open Document</strong> and <strong>Open in New
Window</strong>, allow you to open a new document in the same window or in a
new window respectively. Both commands bring up a dialog box where you can
enter either a local file name or an URL. The dialog box also contains a file
browser that helps you to locate local files. 
<p>
When the document is correctly specified, click on the
<strong>Confirm</strong> button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"Address" area</dt>
<dd>
This area displays the file name or the URL of the current document. You can
edit it to specify a different (local or remote) document to be displayed in
the same window. Press the Enter key when the curso is in this area to
actually load the document. 
</dd>
<dt>Following links</dt>
<dd>
<a href="Links.html#L311">Double-click on a link</a> to get the corresponding
document. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Moving backward and forward</h3>
<p>
Two buttons: <img border="0" src="../Icons/Back.gif" align=middle> and <img border="0"
src="../Icons/Forward.gif" align=middle> allow you to go back to the previous page or
forward to the next one.</p>
