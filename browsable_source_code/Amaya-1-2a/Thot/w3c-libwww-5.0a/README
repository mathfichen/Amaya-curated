   This is the README file which you get when you unwrap the W3C Reference
   Library distribution package. Each package contains source code for building
   the Library and a set of example applications. The set of modules included
   in the package is:
   
      Reference Library (libwww)
      
      Line Mode Browser (www)
      
      Mini Server (webd)
      
      Command Line Tool (w3c)
      
      Mini Robot (webbot)
      
      Socket Listen Tool (listen)
      
HANDLING THE DISTRIBUTION FILES

   A distribution file contains the source code and documentation for the
   Library and the example applications. You can get the distribution files
   from the Library top page All distribution files are available as compressed
   tar files, gzipped tar files, or as zip files. For the compressed tar files,
   first uncompress and untar the file _w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.Z_where X is the
   version number, for example _4.0_:
   
        uncompress w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.Z

        gunzip w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.gz

   Then untar the file by typing
   
        tar xf w3c-libwww-X.X.tar

   For the zip files, type the following:
   
        unzip w3c-libwww-X.X.zip

INSTALLATION

   Please look at the special installation documentation
   
REFERENCE LIBRARY (LIBWWW)

   The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that can be used to build
   clients and servers. It contains code for accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News,
   WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system. Furthermore it provides
   modules for parsing, managing and presenting hypertext objects to the user
   and a wide spectra of generic programming utilities. The Library is the
   basis for many World-Wide Web applications and all the W3C software is build
   on top of it. The Library is a required part of all other W3C applications
   in this distribution.
   
LINE MODE BROWSER (WWW)

   The W3C Line Mode Browser is a simple character based client. It is
   developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the Common Code
   Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non- interactive mode and as a
   proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities for data
   format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool
   for quick access to the Web or used in batch jobs.
   
   Installation is very simple as the application can run without any
   particular setup. You can specify your own HOME PAGEusing the
   WWW_HOMEenvironment variable. Remember toy setup a NNTPSERVERenvironment
   variable before you try to access a news server.
   
MINI SERVER (WEBD)

   The W3C Mini Server is a cross platform server frame work that can be used
   as a basis for writing portable servers. It is _NOT_ a full server - only a
   frame! It is developed in C and serves as an example of a server application
   using the W3C Reference Library.
   
COMMAND LINE TOOL (W3C)

   The W3C Command Line Tool is a cross platform command line tool for
   accessing the Web. It is developed in C and serves as an example of a client
   application using the W3C Reference Library and as a test-tool for quick
   access to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc. It gives a variety of
   possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily
   intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in scripts, cron
   jobs etc.
   
MINI ROBOT (WEBBOT)

   The W3C Mini Robot is a cross platform command line tool for accessing the
   Web. It is developed in C and serves as an example of a robot application
   using the W3C Reference Library and as a test-tool for quick access to the
   Web from scripts, cron jobs etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool for
   quick access to the Web or used in scripts, cron jobs etc.
   
SOCKET LISTEN TOOL (LISTEN)

   The W3C Socket Listen Tool is a cross platform tool for debugging what is
   being sent over the wire. It simply listens on a socket and forwards
   everything to stderr or whatever is available on the actual platform. It is
   developed in C and serves as an example application using the W3C Reference
   Library
