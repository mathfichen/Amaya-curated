<p>
<strong>Amaya</strong> has been designed with the primary purpose of being a
testbed for experimenting and demonstrating new specifications and extensions
of Web protocols and standards. Its current main features include WYSIWYG
editing for HTML documents including MathML elements,  access to and
publishing on HTTP servers, support and editing for Cascading Style
Sheets.</p>
<p>
Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring tool. We
have chosen not to distinguish the editor mode form the browser mode; so the
user can browse and edit any Web pages in the same time. For that reason, the
simple click is used to select into documents for performing any editing
action and the user has to double click to follow a link.</p>
