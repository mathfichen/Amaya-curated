# Supporting the preservation of legacy source code.

This project aims at preserving the source code and the history of the Amaya browser and editor, developped at Inria and W3C between 1996 and 2013. 

The project is structured within two different branches.

- The SourceCode branch features the source code of Amaya and its different versions. The original code was stored on a CVS server of the W3C and [archived on Github](https://github.com/w3c/Amaya-Editor) by Laurent Carcone (W3C, Irnia)
- The Depository branch showcases different documents collected during the preservation processes.
  - The `raw_source_code` and `browsable_source_code` feature some extra versions of the Amaya source code retrieved from the archived Amaya Website by Internet Archive.
  - The `additional_material` folder contains extra material collected during the process (photos, articles)
  - The `metadata` folder contains a catalogue, featuring all the collected item and some other metadata regarding the curation process.

This project gave birth to a presentation of Amaya that can be found here: [Amaya's Software Story](https://stories.k2.services/publisher/collections/50/embed/stories/Q455973?api-key=tN5X1y7O.2NhLogJVhLsYANuCtSP1FjHPZHA6TUBd) (link to be updated).
