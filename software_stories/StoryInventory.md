# Amaya Software Story

## Instructions

See [Amaya story here](https://stage.stories.k2.services/publisher/collections/50/embed/stories/Q455973?api-key=tN5X1y7O.2NhLogJVhLsYANuCtSP1FjHPZHA6TUBd) (work in progress)
A software story is made up of successive _moments_. Different types of moments exist and can be arranged in the desired order:
- **Timeline moment**: shows a timeline of events. Each event is defined by a title, a year, a short description and possibly a picture.
- **People moment**: shows a gallery of contributor's portrait. Each portrait is define by the contributor name, their picture and a short description.
- **Image moment**: shows a chosen picture. The picture has a title, a subtitle and a caption.
- **Video moment**: shows a chosen video. The video has a title, a subtitle and a caption.
- **Iframe moment**: displays an iframe of a given website. Has a title and subtitle.
- **Software heritage moment**: shows a view into the archived source code in the Software heritage archive. Has a title and subtitle.
- **Map moment**: shows the different places associated with the software history 

The title of each moment will display on the side bar and will help the viewer navigate the different moments. 
The template proposed below is structured from the more general information regarding Amaya to the most specific:
- A first image moment shows a first view of Amaya and quickly presents what Amaya is about
- A timeline moment narrates the bigger story around Amaya, and the link between Amaya and the history of the Wolrd Wide Web.
- A people moment introduces Amaya's contributers.
- An iframe moment (to be fixed) shows a snapshot into Amaya mailing list and shows how Amaya community organized itself.
- Another timeline moment shows how Amaya features and design evolved in time
- A software heritage moment shows a view into Amaya source code
- Two image moments give some statistics and insights on Amaya source code.

* 1983
  *  Date title: The Grif project starts at Inria
  *  Description: INRIA, CNRS and the University of Grenoble start the Grif project. At that time, producing documents with a computer was much more complex than today. The project aimed at combining the advantages of structured formatters (such as LateX) and those of interactive and real-time rendering systems. The first version was developed on a PERQ workstation, one of the first personal computers with a graphical interface.

   *  Description: The original name of the editor/browser was Tamaya. A tamaya is a tree, as represented on the logo. It was chosen as a name because such a tree was present in the team’s office. The team members thought the tree could style both the image of the Net and the structure of a Web page. Unfortunately, they were not allowed to keep using the name since it was used as as trade mark by a French company. They decided to drop the first letter (T) and the browser became Amaya
