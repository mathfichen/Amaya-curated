   Welcome to the W3C Reference Code Distribution! You have just unpacked one
   of our distribution files and can find the contents in the w3c-libwww-x.x
   directory where x.x indicates the version. Please read the README file in
   this directory for details on how to go on from here. The README file gives
   you information about what each distribution file contains and what you need
   in order to compile and build one or more of the applications. You can find
   the complete W3C software distribution at
   
        http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Distribution.html

   All our software distribution packages contain documentation written in
   HTML. You can therefore use your favorite browser to browse through the
   documentation locally so that you do not need to use the network. Please
   read the README file in each of the application directories in order to find
   the top page of the documentation for each module. For example, the README
   file for the W3C Reference Library can be found in
   
        w3c-libwww-x.x/Library/README

   If you do not have a browser then please continue and build the Line Mode
   Browser (www) which you can find in the directory
   

        w3c-libwww-x.x/LineMode

   If you can not find this directory then please download the Line Mode
   Browser distribution file from
   

        http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/LineMode/

   or by using anonymous FTP to ftp.w3.org. When the Line Mode Browser is built
   then you can use this application to browse through the documentation.
   
   If you encounter problems or would like to feed back suggestions, good ideas
   etc. then please send a mail to libwww@w3.org noting the version of the
   distribution files that you are using.
