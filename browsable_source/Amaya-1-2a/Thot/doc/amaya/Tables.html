<h2>Editing tables</h2>
<p>
There is no separate table editor in <strong>Amaya</strong>. A table is simply
a structure described by the HTML DTD and it is edited as such. The same
commands apply to tables as to other HTML structures.</p>
<p>
Tables can be created very efficiently with the <a
href="Creating.html#L906">Return key</a>. Create a one-cell table with the
table button or the <strong>Table</strong> entry from the
<strong>Types</strong> menu. The insertion point is then moved to the caption
of that table. Enter the caption and/or move to the first cell. Type in the
content of that cell (Cell 1.1 for example). Create a second cell by hitting
the Return key twice (the first hit creates a paragraph in the first cell). To
create a new row, press Return three times. To create a new tbody, press
Return four times, etc.</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>Captiion</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 1.1
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.2
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 2.1
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
When you have built the previous table by creating 3 cells, Amaya have had
automatically generated an empty cell (future Cell 2.2). You can click on it
and insert text. You can also move to this empty cell by using arrow keys.
When the selection is at the end of the text "Cell 2.1", you can create a new
column between Cell 2.1 and the empty cell by pressing Return key twice.</p>
<p>
There is no specific command to create and destroy a column. When you create
new cell, Amaya generates a new column and when you destroy a cell in a column
that becomes empty, Amaya destroys the column.</p>
<p>
Note that the table model implemented in <strong>Amaya</strong>, while being
fully compatible with that defined in <a
href="../../Wilbur/">HTML&nbsp;3.2</a>, is extended to implement the W3C
Working Draft <a href="../../TR/WD-tables">The HTML3 Table Model</a>, which
has been accepted by the IETF as a proposed standard,<a
href="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1942.txt"> RFC1942</a>.  This includes
features such as multiple bodies (<code>tbody</code>), header
(<code>thead</code>) and footer (<code>tfoot</code>).</p>
