<h2>Creating new elements</h2>

<h3>Buttons and <strong>Types</strong> menu</h3>
<p>
The simplest way to create new elements in a document is to move the insertion
point to the desired position and to use the <strong>Types</strong> menu or
the buttons corresponding to the most common elements (image, headings, lists,
etc.). These buttons and menu items create the corresponding element at the
current position.</p>
<p>
In some cases, the desired element cannot be created exactly at the position
chosen, because of the constraints imposed by the HTML DTD.
<strong>Amaya</strong> then tries to create the element at the closest
position where it is allowed.  For instance, if the insertion point is at the
end of the last line of a paragraph when you click on the H<sub>2</sub>button,
<strong>Amaya</strong> does not create the new heading at that particular
position (which would be invalid), but after the paragraph (which is probably
what you intended).</p>
<p>
In some other cases, <strong>Amaya</strong> changes the existing structure for
creating the desired element. If the insertion point is somewhere within a
list item (<code>LI</code>) when you click on the H<sub>2</sub>button, the
list item and its enclosing list are automatically split, in order to create
the requested heading at the chosen position and to comply with the HTML
DTD.</p>
<p>
When creating new elements, it is important to select an <em>insertion
point</em>, not some text nor a single character: if the current selection is
not empty, <strong>Amaya</strong> tries to <a
href="Changing.html#L631"><em>transform</em></a> the selected part into the
element type chosen.</p>

<h4>Generated elements</h4>
<p>
Some HTML elements are constituted by several other elements of different
types. For instance, a table contains usually a caption (<code>CAPTION</code>)
and several rows (<code>TR</code>) and several cells (<code>TD</code> or
<code>TH</code>) in each row.</p>
<p>
When <strong>Amaya</strong> creates such elements, it also creates their
components. A table is created with a caption and a row containing a single
cell. The insertion point is placed automatically in the first of these
components. You can enter the content of that component immediately or later.
You can move to the next (empty) component with the mouse or with the arrow
keys.</p>

<h3><a name="L906">The Return (or Enter) key</a></h3>
<p>
When you are writing a new document or a new part in a document, you often
create elements sequentially. To do that, just press the Enter (or Return)
key. The current element is terminated and a new one is created just after.
This applies obviously to paragraphs, but also to other types of elements,
such as headings for instance.</p>
<p>
Most often, the new element created is simply a paragraph, whatever the type
of the previous element. If you need another element type, you can immediatly
change the type of that element, by selecting the desired type in the
<strong>Types</strong> menu or by clicking on the corresponding button, but
you can also keep typing and <a href="Changing.html#L653">change the type</a>
later.</p>

<h4>Multiple Returns at the end of an element</h4>
<p>
When the insertion point is in an empty element, pressing the Return key
<em>replaces</em> that element by another empty element at the next higher
level in the document structure. This feature allows you to create complex
nested structures very quickly.</p>
<p>
As an example, consider the following structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The first item in the highest level list. 
<p>
A paragraph in the first item.</p>
<li>
The second item. 
<ol type=a>
<li>
First item in the nested list. 
<li>
Second item in the nested list. 
</ol>
<li>
Last item in the list. 
</ol>
<p>
To create that structure, create first a numbered list with a first item by
clicking on the <img border="0" src="../Icons/NumList.gif" align=middle> button and
type in the first line. At the end of that first line, press the Return key:
it creates a new paragraph in the item. At the end of this paragraph, press
the Return key: it creates yet another paragraph, but pressing the same key
again replaces that paragraph by an empty item 2. At the end of the first line
of item 2, click on the <img border="0" src="../Icons/NumList.gif" align=middle>
button, to create the nested list with its first item. Item b. is created by a
double Return at the end of item a. When the insertion point is at the end of
item b, create item 3 by four successive Returns. To create the paragraph that
follows these lists, press Return three times when the insertion point is at
the end of item 3.</p>

<h4>Multiple Returns at the beginning of an element</h4>
<p>
The Return key works in the same way when the insertion point is at the
beginning of an element, but it creates new elements <em>before</em> the
current element.</p>
<p>
For instance, you can add an initial paragraph in a list item by moving the
insertion point before the first character of that item and pressing Return.
If you press Return twice, you get a new item before the current item. This is
useful for inserting a new item before the first one.</p>
<p>
This use of the Return key does not apply only to lists and paragraphs, but to
all elements. It is for instance very convenient for <a
href="Manual.html">creating tables</a>.</p>

<h4>Exiting anchors or styled character strings</h4>
<p>
When a paragraph or another block of text is styled - terminated by an anchor
or a character string in bold, italic or other such style - moving the
insertion point to the end and typing appends characters to the anchor or the
styled string. If you want to exit this styled element and enter plain text,
just press Return and continue typing.</p>
<p>
The same method can be used to enter plain text at the <em>beginning</em> of a
block starting with an anchor or styled characters.</p>

<h4>Changing the document Title</h4>
<p>
You can edit the document title (TITLE element) in the Title field of the main
window. When the new title is OK, you must validate it by hitting the Retun
key.</p>
