<h1>Compiling Amaya Sources with Autoconf</h1>
<p>
This document explains how to compile the <strong>Amaya</strong> environment
(<strong>Amaya</strong> binary and <strong>Thot</strong> schemas compilers)
from the distributed <a href="Sources.html">source tree</a>.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="L437">Prerequisite:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
We strongly recommend to use a GNU make and if possible GNU CC since these are
the tools used by the Amaya Team, and very few testings have been done with
other flavours of make and C compilers.
<li>
You need the Thot library source code archive thot-src-xxx.tar.gz and the
Amaya source code archive amaya-src-yyy.tar.gz.
<li>
Having usual Unix development tools, at least <code>sed</code>,
<code>awk</code> and <code>cpp</code> should be available.
<li>
Amaya requires X-Windows (X11R5 or X11R6) and Motif (1.2.x or 2.0). Amaya
should now work fine with latests versions (0.8.0 and later) of <a
href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a> (a free Motif clone).
</ul>

<h3><a name="L438">How to build in 4 steps:</a></h3>
<p>
Here is a simple recipe explaining how to build using autoconf:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Install your source code tree:
<pre>gunzip -c /tmp/amaya-src-xxx.tar.gz | tar xvf -</pre>
<p>
this will create a Thot subtree of approximately 13
MBytes.<strong></strong></p>
<li>
<span style="color : #FF0000">Create a subtree (obj)</span>  for object and
lauch configure to create the Makefile(s):
<pre>cd Thot
mkdir obj 
cd obj 
../configure</pre>
<p>
Configure accepts 4 specific parameters allowing to select packages to be
compiled:</p>
<pre>      
      --with-amaya            Build the Amaya HTML browser/editor
      --enable-java           Add Kaffe Java virtual machine
      --enable-plugin         Add Netscape Plug-Ins support</pre>
<p>
<strong>Java</strong> (network accesses are done using
<strong>libWWW</strong>) and <strong>Plugins</strong> are not available by
default.  To compile <strong>Amaya</strong> with Plugins, use the
following:</p>
<pre> ../configure --enable-plugin
 </pre>
<p>
To compile <strong>Amaya</strong> with Java support, you need to retrieve the
Amaya-java source distribution. Then, you need to type the following:</p>
<pre> ../configure --enable-java
 </pre>

This creates all the Makefiles needed and generate an Options.orig file
containing all the variable which can be tuned. For example one can just
change the CFLAGS values. Be careful, autoconf usually set up the debug flag
"-g" which tends to generate very big library and binaries.
<p>
With -g the obj  tree can grow up to 100 MBytes while without it it won't use
more than 20 MBytes.</p>
<p>
It also gives some hints on how the source tree is configured.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>
Build everything:
<pre>make all</pre>
<p>
It is strongly recommended to use GNU make, which may not be the default make
on your system. In this case try:</p>
<pre>gmake all</pre>
<p>
or</p>
<pre>gnumake all</pre>
<p>
The compilation process can take a fair amount of time, 10 minutes at
least.</p>
<p>
You can test the result immediately by lauching Amaya binary built in the bin
directory:</p>
<pre>bin/amaya</pre>
<li>
If amaya binary seems fine you can install it:
<pre>make install</pre>
<p>
By default, the binaries are installed in /usr/local/bin, libraries in
/usr/local/lib and all data are in /usr/local/share/thot. This can be
overrided by specifying different values for prefix(es) using configure
command line options in step 2.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, if you're not satisfied with your current Amaya installation, you
can clean up with:</p>
<pre>make uninstall</pre>
</ol>

<h3><a name="L1046">More info on the make files</a></h3>
<p>
All the Makefile(s) build in the object tree are generated by configure script
and Makefile.in templates found in the source tree. It generates a main
Makefile at the top of the object tree and a set of Makefiles in most of the
directory of the object tree. The main Makefile accepts the following
targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
make <strong>rebuild</strong> : rebuild all the Makefile(s) from the autoconf
and Makefile.in files.
<li>
make <strong>depend</strong> : rebuild all the dependencies in the object
tree.
<li>
make <strong>proto</strong> : rebuild all the prototype include files xxx_f.h
from their xxx.c counterpart.
<li>
make <strong>clean</strong> : removes all object files, but keep the binaries
in <code>Thot/</code><strong>obj </strong><code>/bin</code> .
<li>
make <strong>kaffe</strong> : rebuild the kaffe libraries and binaries (if
sources are available).
<li>
make <strong>libwww</strong> : rebuild the libwww.a library from
Thot/w3c-libwww-5.0a tree.
<li>
make <strong>libjpeg</strong> : rebuild the libjpeg.a library from
Thot/libjpeg tree.
<li>
make <strong>libpng</strong> : rebuild the libpng.a and libz.a libraries from
Thot/libpng tree.
<li>
make without argument rebuild evrything.
<li>
make <strong>amaya</strong> rebuild <strong>Amaya</strong> binary.
<li>
make <strong>classes</strong> rebuild <strong>Java</strong>
<code>.class</code> files from their <code>.java</code> sources. With some
versions of kaffe it may be a good idea to increase the maximum size of a Java
V.M. while compiling by adding " <code>-mx 64000000</code> " before
<code>sun.tools.javac.Main</code> in <code>bin/javac</code> file.
</ul>
<p>
One can also go to a specific sub-directory in the object tree and launch make
from that place. It will rebuild all the objects pertaining to this
directory.</p>
<p>
Next section try to give some hint on debugging errors at compile-time.</p>

<h3><a name="L440">If make failed:</a></h3>
<p>
Errors may append at diffferent stages in the compilation process. Here is a
small checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
from the start: typing make in the <code>Thot/</code><strong>obj </strong>
directory doesn't work. This means that the step 1 or 2 of the <a
href="#L666">previous section</a> failed.
<ol>
<li>
do you use GNU make? The Makefile organization heavily relies on including
sub-Makefiles and some old versions of Make don't support it.
<li>
do you have write access on the <code>Thot/</code><strong>obj </strong>
directory ?
<li>
do you have all mandatory sources ?
</ol>
<li>
an error when compiling a C file occured. This should not be the case on any
of the supported platform:
<ol>
<li>
check that you have some room left for the object.
<li>
verify the include path for the X-Windows and Motif include files in
<code>Thot/</code><strong>obj </strong><code>/Options.</code>
<li>
verify that the target directory for the object exist and is writable. The
object name is shown in the make output behind the <strong>-o</strong> flag.
<li>
check that you are using an ANSI compliant compiler, while the code should
compile with non-ANSI ones, we don't test this feature on a regular basis.
<li>
If the error occurs when compiling a C file in the amaya directory, check that
all the compilers invocations in steps 7 to 11 did not produce any error (the
Thot compilers are verbose so errors messages may not be easily detected).
<li>
otherwise your best bet is to report the problem to the <strong>Amaya</strong>
development Team, by sending the error to the <code>www-amaya@w3.org</code>
mailing-list. Please check first the <a
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/">archive</a>, the error may
have been already reported.
</ol>
<li>
an error running a compiler schema occured:
<ol>
<li>
be sure that the compilers were properly build in step 5, check with
<strong>ldd</strong> that there is no missing shared library, e.g:
<p>
<code>ldd bin/app</code></p>
<li>
be sure that <strong>cpp</strong> preprocessor is in the PATH. One can use the
following shell script in conjuction with gcc, name it cpp, put it in the PATH
with 755 Unix rights:
<pre>#!/bin/sh
        exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $*</pre>
<li>
check that you have write right access on Thot/amaya directory.
<li>
One can force the compiler to rebuild the amaya and HTML schemas by typing:
<p>
<code>touch ../amaya/*.S</code></p>
<p>
<code>touch ../amaya/*.A</code></p>
<p>
<code>make amaya</code></p>
</ol>
<li>
an error occured at link time:
<ol>
<li>
Check that the current directory contains all the precompiled libraries,
namely <code>libjpeg.a</code>, <code>libpng.a</code> and <code>libz.a</code>
for the <strong>obj </strong>. If these files are lacking, fetch the
appropriate
<code>thot-libs-</code><strong>target</strong><code>-xxx.tar.gz</code> <a
href="SourceDist.html">distribution</a> file and install it.
<li>
Check that the precompiled libraries are not corrupted e.g.:
<p>
<code>file libwww.a</code></p>
<p>
<code>nm libwww.a</code></p>
<p>
should not print any errors</p>
<li>
In case of a corrupted library, one can reextract it from the distribution
file or rebuild it by giving one of the appropriate commands:
<p>
make libjpeg</p>
<p>
make libpng</p>
<p>
make libwww</p>
<p>
In case of problem building the WWW library, please check it's <a
href="/INSTALL.html">installation instructions</a>. Compiling the graphic
libraries should be quite straightforward.</p>
<li>
verify the library path (<strong>-L</strong> flags in
<strong>LINK_OPTIONS</strong>) for the X-Windows and Motif libraries files in
<code>Thot/</code><strong>obj </strong><code>/Makefile</code>.
<li>
Check whether <strong>-lSM</strong> and <strong>-lICE</strong>  X11R6
libraries are needed. These were not needed (available) when working on an
X11R5 environment.
<li>
If amaya linking complains about <strong>XLookupString</strong>, check in
<code>Thot/amaya/EDITOR.A</code> that the section USES does not refer to
<strong>Lookup</strong>. If needed, remove it, and restart
<p>
<code>make amaya</code></p>
<p>
This is related to the input of ISO-Latin-1 sequences in Motif dialog
boxes.</p>
<li>
Otherwise your best bet is to report the problem to the <strong>Amaya</strong>
development Team, by sending the error to the <code>www-amaya@w3.org</code>
mailing-list. Please check first the <a
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/">archive</a>, the error may
have been already reported
</ol>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L689">If amaya binary doesn't work:</a></h3>
<p>
Here is a few rules to check if the amaya binary just produced does not
start:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Check that the shared libraries needed by amaya are found on the system. The
command
<p>
<code>ldd bin/amaya           on Suns or Linux</code></p>
<p>
<code>chatr bin/amaya         on HP's</code></p>
<p>
should print all the shared libraries needed by amaya and the path to the
corresponding libraries in the system.</p>
<li>
Check that the amaya compiled <strong>shemas</strong> are present, namely
<code>Thot/amaya/HTML.STR</code>, <code>Thot/amaya/HTMLP.PRS</code>...
<li>
Verify that the main <a href="Registry.html">registry</a> file
<code>Thot/config/thot.ini</code> is present.
</ol>
<p>
If everything seems Ok, one can debug the problem by using a system call
tracer like <strong>truss</strong> on Solaris or <strong>strace</strong> on
Linux. Check for syscalls errors near the end of the system trace dump.</p>
<p>
All the remaining technics to find out what's wrong are software debugging
methods, for this of course one need to recompile the binary with debug option
enabled, and use a debugger program to see what's happening exactly. Once a
bug has been identified, please report it to the <strong>Amaya</strong>
development Team, by sending the error to the <code>www-amaya@w3.org</code>
mailing-list. Please check first the <a
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/">archive</a>, the error may
have been already reported. Of course, sending a contextual diff of the
modified files may help correcting the problem, and have it patched on next
release.</p>
