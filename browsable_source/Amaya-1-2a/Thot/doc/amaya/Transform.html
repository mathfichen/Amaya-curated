<H1 align=center>Use of the file HTML.trans</H1>

<P>
This document is an introduction to the structure transformation mechanism
provided by <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG>. It describes the syntax of the
transformation language and the way transformations are performed in the
editor.</P>
<P>
The file <CODE>amaya/HTML.trans</CODE> contains the description of available
transformations. This file can be edited during an <STRONG>Amaya</STRONG>
session. It is dynamically parsed when the transformation procedure is called
by the editor. So new transformations can be added during an editing
session.</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: as the description of transformations may contain
tags, do<STRONG> not </STRONG>edit file <CODE>HTML.trans</CODE> with
<STRONG>Amaya</STRONG>. You can use any text editor.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Syntax of the Amaya transformation language</H2>

<P>
Comments begin with<CODE><STRONG>!</STRONG></CODE>and continue until the end
of the line.</P>
<P>
The file consists of a list of transformation descriptions. Each
transformation is described by three parts :</P>
<UL>
<LI>a <EM>name </EM>terminated by a colon <STRONG><CODE>:</CODE></STRONG>
<LI>a <EM>source pattern</EM> terminated by a semi-colon
<STRONG><CODE>;</CODE></STRONG>
<LI>and a list of <EM>rules</EM> between braces <STRONG><CODE>{
}</CODE></STRONG> , each rule terminated by a semi-colon
<STRONG><CODE>;</CODE></STRONG>
</UL>
<P>
The name appears in the Transform menu and identifies the transformation for
the end-user.</P>
<H3>The pattern</H3>

<P>
The pattern describes a specific organization of the elements to be
transformed. It acts as a filter over the HTML dtd. The purpose of the pattern
is to identify a particular combination of elements to which the
transformation can be applied. In a pattern it is possible to express
conditions on sequence of tags, on the content of a tag and on the existence
and value of attributes.</P>
<P>
Formally, a pattern contains HTML tags (possibly with attributes) and some
composition operators:</P>
<P>
<STRONG><CODE>| </CODE></STRONG>for choice</P>
<P>
<STRONG><CODE>, </CODE></STRONG>for sibling</P>
<P>
<STRONG><CODE>+ </CODE></STRONG>for sequence</P>
<P>
<STRONG><CODE>? </CODE></STRONG>for option</P>
<P>
<STRONG><CODE>( )</CODE></STRONG> for grouping nodes</P>
<P>
The braces <CODE><STRONG>{</STRONG></CODE> <CODE><STRONG>}</STRONG></CODE>
define the content of a node.</P>
<P>
The symbol <STRONG><CODE>*</CODE></STRONG> is a token that matches any element
type.</P>
<P>
It is possible to rename a tag by preceding it with a name followed by a colon
<STRONG><CODE>:</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P>
The tag may have attributes. If no value is given for an attribute, an element
is matched if the attribute is present. If a value is specified for the
attribute, an element is matched if the attribute is present and have the
specified value.</P>
<P>
<A href="#L235">Examples </A>of patterns are given at the end of the
document.</P>
<H3>The rules</H3>

<P>
A rule expresses how some elements identified in the pattern are transformed.
A rule has two parts separated by the symbol <STRONG><CODE>>
</CODE></STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a source tag or a name defined in the pattern,
<LI>a target tag list, giving the tags to be generated, and the place where
they are inserted when transforming the source element.
</UL>
<P>
The target tag list is itself divided into two parts separated by a colon
<STRONG><CODE>:</CODE></STRONG> :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the generation location path (identifies the place where new tags have to
be inserted).
<LI>and the list of tags to be generated.
</UL>
<P>
The generation location path is searched in the leftmost branch of the
document tree, starting from the parent of  the element matching the highest
symbol of the pattern.</P>
<P>
In the target tag list, the dot symbol "<CODE><STRONG>.</STRONG></CODE>" is
used for descending in the tree structure.</P>
<P>
If the special token star<CODE><STRONG> * </STRONG></CODE>ends the list of
tags to be generated, the source element tag is not changed but it can be
moved to a different place in the destination.</P>
<P>
If the source tag or the name in the left part of a rules is present more than
once in the pattern, the rule transforms all the elements matching an
occurrence of the tag in the pattern.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Transformation process</H2>

<P>
When the user invokes the Transform command from the Types menu, the
<CODE>HTML.trans</CODE> file is parsed. Then the selected elements are matched
with the pattern of each transformation. The names of the matched
transformations are proposed to the user in a pop-up menu.</P>
<P>
If several transformations with the same name match the selected elements, the
higher-level matching transformation is proposed to the user. If several
transformations match at the same level, the first one declared in the
<CODE>HTML.trans</CODE> file is proposed. As a consequence it is recommended
to specify the transformations with specific patterns before the more general
ones.</P>
<P>
Once a transformation has been chosen by the user, the destination structure
is built according to the rules while selected elements are traversed.</P>
<P>
Finally, the contents of the source elements (text and pictures, but also
structured elements) are moved into the produced elements.</P>
<P>
This transformation process for HTML documents is fully described in <A
href="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/OPERA/Papers/WWW96/WWW96.html"><EM>Interactively
Restructuring HTML Documents</EM></A>, a paper presented at the <A
href="http://www5conf.inria.fr/">5th international WWW conference</A> in
Paris, May 96, by C&eacute;cile Roisin and St&eacute;phane Bonhomme.</P>

<UL>
<LI>The first example merges several consecutive unnumbered lists (UL) into an
unique list.
<PRE>
Merge Lists: (UL{LI+})+;
    { 
    LI > UL:LI; 
    }
</PRE>
<P>
The pattern matches a sequence of unnumbered lists (UL), that contain a
sequence of items (LI).</P>
<P>
The rule expresses that each time an item is encountered when traversing the
matched elements, a new LI tag is created within an UL. When the rule is first
applied, the resulting structure is empty, so there is no UL element in which
the LI can be created. Therefore an UL is first created, then the rule can be
applied.</P>
<P>
</P>
<LI>The second example transforms a definition list into a table.
<PRE>
Table: DL{(DT|DD)+}; 
   { 
   DT > &lt;TABLE border=1>.TBODY:TR.TD; 
   DD > &lt;TABLE border=1>.TBODY.TR:TD; 
   }
</PRE>
<P>
The pattern matches any Definition List element (DL).</P>
<P>
The rules explain how the table is incrementally built when the structure of
the selected definition list is traversed :</P>
<UL>
<LI>Each DT involves the creation of a new row (TR) in the table body.
<LI>Each DD involves the creation of a new cell (TD) in the last existing row
of the table.
</UL>
<P>
</P>
<LI>The third example removes a table element, keeping its content unchanged
but extracted from the table.
<PRE>
Remove Table:
TABLE{?CAPTION,?(body:*{(TR{(TD{(?cell_content:*)+}|
                             TH{(?cell_content:*)+}
                           )})+})+};
     { 
     CAPTION>H3; 
     cell_content>:*;
     }
</PRE>
<P>
The pattern matches any table and identifies the content of each cell of the
table (cell_content).</P>
<P>
The second rule expresses that the contents of each cell have to be moved to
the place of the original table.</P>

examples.
