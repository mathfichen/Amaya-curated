<h2><a name="L1023">Style Sheets</a></h2>
<p>
The <strong>Style</strong> menu allows you to change the appearance of your
documents by two different means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
<li>
using HTML elements and attributes. 
</ul>
<p>
The first entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu are dedicated to CSS, the
last two entries to <a href="#L1371">HTML elements</a>.</p>

<h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>

<h4>Creating and updating Style attributes</h4>
<p>
Each of the first four entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu call a
dialog box that allows you to associate a <code>style</code> attribute with
the currently selected elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Character Style</strong> allows you to choose the font family, the
character style, the body size and the underline style. 
<li>
<strong>Colors</strong> allows you to choose the foreground and background
colors from a palette. Click on a palette cell with the left button to set the
foregroud color, click with the middle button to set the backgroud color. 
<li>
<strong>Format</strong> allows you to set  alignment, indentation,
justification and linespacing. 
<li>
<strong>Background Image</strong> allows you to choose a background image and
its repeat mode. 
</ul>
<p>
In all these dialog boxes, <strong>Default</strong> buttons allow you to
remove the corresponding style information from the selected elements.</p>
<p>
All modifications made with these dialog boxes can be viewed immediately in
both the WYSIWYG view and the Structure view.</p>

<h4>Changing width and height of elements</h4>
<p>
The width and height of any element in a document can be changed
interactively, in the same way as <a href="ImageMaps.html#L1171">image map
areas</a>. By pressing the Control key on the keybord and the middle button of
the mouse, you can resize the box associated with the element under the
cursor. When you release the mouse button, the element size is changed and a
<code>style</code> attribute is associated with the element.</p>
<p>
When the resized element is an image, this image is zoomed to fill its new
box.</p>

<h4>Creating, updating and using classes</h4>
<p>
When a <code>style</code> attribute has been associated with an element, you
can use that element as a model for creating or modifying a style rule. Select
this element (you must select only one element and this element must have a
<code>style</code> attribute) and choose <strong>Create Rule</strong> from the
<strong>Style</strong> menu. A dialog box pops up that displays a list of CSS
selectors. This list comprises all classes that are defined for the current
document as well as, the element types to which some style is associated..
Choose a selector in this list or enter a new class name or type name  and
press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. The style of the selected element
is then associated with the chosen selector and the <code>style</code>
attribute is removed from the selected element. Its content is moved to the
<code>STYLE</code> element, in the document <code>HEAD</code>, and all
elements matching the selector are displayed with the new style.</p>
<p>
When you have created new classes with the <strong>Create Rule</strong>
command, you can associate these classes with some elements in the document
document. Choose <strong>Apply Class</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
menu. A dialog box pops up which displays all existing classes. Choose one of
these classes. The selected elements are then displayed with the style
associated with the chosen class.</p>
<p>
To associate a class with an element, you can also use the <a
href="Attributes.html#L1073"><strong>Attributes</strong> menu</a>. This menu
allows you to delete a class attribute from an element or to change it: the
class attribute is handled like any other attribute.</p>

<h4>Editing style sheets</h4>
<p>
Commands <strong>Create Rule</strong> and <strong>Apply Class</strong> provide
the basic functionality for manipulating style information. More complex
manipulations can be made with the CSS dialog box. You can get that dialog box
by clicking the CSS button or by selecting <strong>Style sheets</strong> from
the <strong>Style</strong> menu.</p>
<p>
The CSS dialog box allows you not only to edit the content of a style sheet,
but also to create new sheets and to update existing ones by copying rules
from one sheet to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The two CSS file  selectors allow to select the style sheets from which rules
can be manipulated. In each selector, the currently selected sheet is
highlighted. 
<p>
Entry <em>Document style</em> represents the set of rules gathered in the
STYLE element, in the document HEAD.</p>
<p>
Entry <em>User's preference</em> represents the user style sheet (file
<code>.amaya.css</code> in the user's home directory)</p>
<li>
The two rule selectors show the rules from the selected style sheets. In fact,
they only display the selector part of these rules. Only one rule can be
selected for both selector, which is the current rule, displayed in the text
area below. 
<li>
The text area at the bottom shows the complete current rule (the one selected
from the rule selectors), allowing the user to see and edit the CSS syntax. 
<li>
Between the two rule selectors there is a column of 5 buttons. 
<ul>
<li>
pushing the <img border="0" src="../Icons/lcopy.gif">
 button <em>merges</em> the current rule (as shown in the text area) to the
second style sheet. Changes are immediately reflected in the WYSIWYG View. 
<li>
pushing the <img border="0" src="../Icons/lmerge.gif">
 button <em>copies</em> the current rule to the second style sheet.The
difference with the previous button is that all rules using the same selector
initially present in the file are first removed. 
<li>
pushing the <img border="0" src="../Icons/destroy.gif">
 button deletes the current rule from its style sheet. 
<li>
the buttons <img border="0" src="../Icons/rcopy.gif">
 and <img src="../Icons/rmerge.gif">
 have the same effect as the first two buttons but they act on the first style
sheet.. 
</ul>
<li>
The five buttons at the bottom are used for handling style sheets. 
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Save</strong> initiates the operation of saving all modified style
sheets. 
<li>
<strong>Save as</strong> saves one of the style sheets to a local file. 
<li>
<strong>Reload</strong> is a coarse grained Undo. It reloads all the modified
style sheets referenced by the document. 
<li>
<strong>New</strong> adds an external style sheet to the list of the external
style sheets referenced by the document. It is also possible to browse the
content of a file without attaching it to the document. Amaya keeps an history
of the style sheets encountered. This history is saved from session to
session, and allows you to grab quickly one of the style sheets lastly
referenced, to browse its rules or to attach it to the current document. 
<li>
<strong>Remove</strong> supresses a reference to an external style sheet. 
<li>
<strong>Cancel</strong> closes the CSS dialog box. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L1371">Style through HTML elements</a></h3>
<p>
HTML provides some character-level elements that allow you to associate style
with character strings. Two entires from the <strong>Style</strong> menu allow
you to handle these HTML elements.</p>

<h4>Creating HTML style elements</h4>
<p>
Entry <strong>Information type</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
presents a submenu offering a choice of HTML elements that define abstract
styles. Select first a character string and then choose an item in this menu.
The selected character string receives the corresponding style. Three of these
styles are also available through buttons: <em>emphasis</em> (button<em>
i</em>), <strong>strong</strong> (button <strong>B</strong>) and
<code>code</code> (button <code>TT</code>).</p>
<p>
Entry <strong>Character elements</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
offers another menu for changing the style of text. Most entries of this menu
could be replaced by CSS and should not be used. They are here only for the
sake of completeness of the HTML 3.2 implementation.</p>

<h4>Removing style</h4>
<p>
To remove style from a character string, select the string first and re-apply
the command that was used for associating the style you want to remove. All
commands in the submenus <strong>Information Type</strong> and
<strong>Character Element</strong> toggle themselves if re-applied.</p>
