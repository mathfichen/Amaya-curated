<h2>Creating and changing links and anchors</h2>

<h3><a name="L557">Creating a target anchor</a></h3>
<p>
A target anchor is a piece of text that is referred to by a link (a source
anchor). Before creating a link to such a piece of text, you must first turn
it into a target anchor.</p>
<p>
Just select a character string with the mouse and choose <strong>Create
Target</strong> from the <strong>Links</strong> menu. The selected text is now
<a href="Browsing.html#L515">displayed in green</a>, which identifies it as a
target anchor. Amaya automatically generates the NAME attribute value:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
either by extracting a word longer than 3 characters form the anchor
content,</p>
<li><p>
or by generating a number.</p>
</ul>
<p>
In both cases, Amaya guarantees that the generated value is unique.</p>

<h3><a name="target1">Creating a target element</a></h3>
<p>
In HTML 4.0, an element can be used as a target of links. A target element is
a typed element that has an ID attribute which is referred to by a link (a
source anchor). Before creating a link to such an element, you must first turn
it into a target element.</p>
<p>
You can create a target element in the same way you create a target anchor.
Just select a character string within the element, use the Esc key to select
the element itself and choose <strong>Create Target</strong> from the
<strong>Links</strong> menu. The selected element has now an ID attribute,
which identifies it as a target element. Amaya automatically generated this
unique ID value.</p>
<p>
It's also possible to directly create the ID attribute by using the <strong><a
href="Attributes.html#Attributes">Attributes</a></strong> menu when the
element is selected. When the value has been entered, Amaya checks this value
and changes it if it is already used by another NAME or ID attribute in the
same document.</p>

<h3><a name="L245">Creating a link</a></h3>

<h4>External links</h4>
<p>
To create an anchor that is a link to another document:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="Selecting.html#Selecting">Select</a> the extent of the anchor to be
created 
<li>
Click the <img src="../Icons/Link.gif" align=middle>
 button or choose <strong>Create Link</strong> from the <strong>Links</strong>
menu 
<li>
If the target document is displayed by <strong>Amaya</strong>, just click
anywhere on it. The link is created. 
<p>
If the target document is not displayed</p>
<ul>
<li>
click anywhere in the current document, except on a green anchor 
<li>
a dialog box pops up: enter the URL of the target document and click on the
<strong>Confirm</strong> button. The link is created. 
</ul>
</ol>

<h4>Internal links</h4>
<p>
To create a link to a particular anchor in the same document or in another,
replace step 3 above by:</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">
click in any view on the <a href="#L557">target anchor</a> or a target
element, which should be displayed in green in the Formatted view. The link is
created. 
</ol>

<h3>Removing a link or a target anchor</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Links</strong> menu contains a command that reverses the two
commands above: <strong>Delete Anchor</strong>. Put the selection or the
insertion point anywhere within the anchor to be removed (you do not need to
select the whole anchor, but you can) and activate the <strong>Delete
Anchor</strong> command. The anchor is removed, but its content remains.</p>

<h3>Changing a link</h3>
<p>
If you want to keep an anchor but to change the target of the corresponding
link, select any part of that anchor or just put the insertion point within
the anchor, and choose <strong>Change Link</strong> from the
<strong>Links</strong> menu. Then designate the new target of the anchor as
above (step 3 in the <a href="#L245">creation of a link</a>).</p>
<p>
To change the target of a link, you can also edit the <code>href</code>
attribute, either directly in the Structure view or in the Links view or using
the <a href="Attributes.html#Attributes"><strong>Attributes</strong></a>
menu.</p>
