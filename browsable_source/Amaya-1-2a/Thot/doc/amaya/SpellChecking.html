<h2><a name="L1063">Spell checking</a></h2>
<p>
Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker. This tool is invoked by the
<strong>Spell Check</strong> command from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu. It
uses the <code>LANG</code> attribute to select the right dictionary. You can
associate this attribute with any element in a document, even with a single
word. Use the <strong>Language</strong> command in the <strong><a
href="Attributes.html#L1073">Attributes</a></strong> menu  for that
purpose.</p>
<p>
Before starting Amaya, the user can set the  <code>EXTENDDICT=</code>
parameter in the registry file ($HOME/.thotrc file) which determines the name
of the personal dictionary used for all documents. By default this dictionary
is $HOME/.thot.DIC. Thus, the checker will use, in addition to the
dictionaries specific to the language, this dictionary (in read-write mode) to
control all documents.This dictionary is created and automatically updated by
the spelling checker when the commands ``Skip (+dic)'' and ``Replace (+dic)''
are issued (see below).</p>
<p>
The <strong>Spell Check</strong> command in <strong>Edit</strong> menu
displays a form which enables you to choose the correction parameters and to
interact with the checker:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The maximum number of proposals is specified in the <strong>Number of
proposal</strong>s area. This number can take any value between 1 and 10, the
default value is 3. Once an error has been detected, any change made to this
value immediately displays a new list of proposals.
<li>
Several buttons in <strong>Ignore</strong> submenu allow you to ignore certain
words: for example words that contain capital letters, digits, Roman numerals
or special characters indicated in the list below. This list can be modified
by the user.
<li>
The <strong>Checking</strong> submenu, similar to that in the <strong><a
href="Searching.html">Search</a></strong> form, allows you to specify the part
of document on which the checker will work.
<li>
The erroneous word is displayed in the area<strong> Spell
checking....</strong> The list of proposals is displayed in the selector
located below the incorrect word. By default, the first proposal of correction
is selected. To select another proposal, simply click on it. The selected
proposal is displayed below the selector. This proposal can be directly
modified in the form. The correction is made once you have clicked on one of
the buttons <strong>Replace and next</strong> or <strong>Replace
(+dic)</strong>.
<li>
The language in which the correction is made is specified in the top left
corner of the form. To change the language, just apply an attribute  Language
to the text concerned by using the <a
href="Attributes.html#Attributes"><strong>Attributes</strong></a> menu and
restart the correction procedure.
</ul>
<p>
To start the correction, click on the <strong>Skip and next</strong> button
bottom of the form. If an error has been found, the incorrect word is selected
and highlighted in the document. If no error has been detected, the "Not
found" message is displayed in the bottom right corner of the form.</p>
<p>
The user can then use one of the buttons placed at the bottom of the form to
perform one of the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Done</strong>: the form disappears and checking is aborted. Previous
corrections are not canceled.
<li>
<strong>Skip and next:</strong> the word considered incorrect is acceptable.
No change is made in the text nor in the dictionaries. The checker searches
for the next error.
<li>
<strong>Skip (+dic)</strong>: it is the same as ``Skip and next'' but the word
considered incorrect is added to the spelling dictionary specific to the
document, thus the checker will ignore any subsequent occurrence of this word.
<li>
<strong>Replace and next</strong>: the word considered as erroneous is
replaced by the correct word (changed or modified by the user, see above) and
the checker searches for the next error.
<li><p>
<strong>Replace (+dic)</strong>: it is the same as.<strong>Replace and
next</strong>: except that the replacement word is added to the document
dictionary.</p>
</ul>
