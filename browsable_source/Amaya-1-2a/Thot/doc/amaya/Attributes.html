<h2>Editing attributes</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to edit attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
the <strong>Attribute</strong> menu, 
<li>
the Structure view. 
</ul>

<h3><a name="L1073">Editing attributes through the Attribute menu</a></h3>
<p>
The <strong>Attribute</strong> menu lists all attributes that can be
associated with the selected element. It can be used to create an attribute,
to change the value of an existing attribute or to delete an attribute.</p>
<p>
To edit an attribute, first select the appropriate element.  You must select
the entire element, not simply a character within the element; use the <a
href="Selecting.html#L894">Esc key</a> for this. When the element is selected,
choose the attribute to be edited from the <strong>Attributes</strong> menu.
Then <strong>Amaya</strong> acts according to the chosen attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If it is a boolean attribute (such as <code>ismap</code> for an image), the
command is finished. Choosing that attribute in the menu removes it from the
selected element, if it is present, or adds it if not. 
<li>
If is is an attribute with a limited set of values (such as <code>align</code>
for a paragraph or a heading), a dialog box pops up. It contains a menu of the
available values and three buttons. 
<ul>
<li>
If you want to create this attribute or to change its value, choose the
desired value from the menu and click on the <strong>Apply</strong> button. 
<li>
If you want to remove that attribute, click on the <strong>Delete</strong>
button. 
</ul>
<li>
If it is an attribute with a free value (such as <code>href</code> for an
anchor), a dialog box pops up. In this dialog box, you can edit the attribute
value; terminate the command with the <strong>Apply</strong> button. To remove
the attribute, click on the <strong>Delete</strong> button. 
</ul>

<h3>Editing attributes in the Structure view</h3>
<p>
All attributes are displayed in the Structure view. Attributes whose value can
be chosen freely are displayed in black and you can edit their value like any
other character string. When the attribute value is displayed in blue, you can
only change it with the <strong>Attribute</strong> menu. This ensures that
only one of the correct values is chosen.</p>
