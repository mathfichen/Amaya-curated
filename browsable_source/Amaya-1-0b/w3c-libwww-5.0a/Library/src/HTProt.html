  The Protocol Class

<P>
The Protocol class defines an application level protocol (HTTP, FTP, Gopher,
etc.) to be used by libwww. Please note that access to the local file system
also is considered to be an appliaction level protocol treated identically
to for example the HTTP protocol. The Protocol class does only know about
the application layer protocol and it relies on the
<A HREF="HTTrans.html">Transport Class</A> to do the actualt communication
with the network, the local file system etc. The protocol class defines an
access method for botg a client and a server. A typical client application
would probably only want to use the client method and a server only the server
method. However, any application can use both which allows it to seemlessly
to change between server and client profile as needed.
<P>
<B>Note</B>: The library <B>core</B> does not define any default application
layer protocols - they are all considered part of the application. The library
comes with a default set of protocols including the ones mentioned above
which can be initiated using the function <CODE>HTProtocolInit()</CODE> in
<A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit module</A>
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTProt.c">HTProt.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C Reference
Library</A>.

<P>
An access scheme module takes as a parameter a socket (which is an invalid
socket the first time the function is called), a
<A HREF="HTReqMan.html">request structure</A> containing details of the request,
and the action by which the (valid) socket was selected in the event loop.
When the protocol class routine is called, the anchor element in the request
is already valid (made valid by HTAccess).

  Creation and Deletion Methods
</H2>
<H3>
  Add an Protocol
</H3>
<P>
This functions registers a protocol module and binds it to a specific access
acheme (the part before the first colon in a URL). For example, the HTTP
&nbsp;client module is bound to http URLs. The callback function is the function
to be called for loading. 
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_add (const char *       	name,
			    const char *	transport,
			    BOOL		preemptive,
			    HTEventCallback *	client,
			    HTEventCallback *	server);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Delete a Protocol
</H3>
<P>
This functions deletes a registered protocol module so that it can not be
used for accessing a resource anymore.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_delete (const char * name);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Remove ALL Registered Protocols
</H3>
<P>
This is the garbage collection function. It is called by
<A HREF="HTLib.html">HTLibTerminate()</A>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_deleteAll (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Protocol Class Methods
</H2>
<H3>
  Find a Protocol Object
</H3>
<P>
You can search the list of registered protocol objects as a function of the
access acheme. If an access scheme is found then the protocol object is returned.
<PRE>
extern HTProtocol * HTProtocol_find (HTRequest * request, const char * access);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Get the callback functions
</H3>
<P>
You can get the callback functions registered together with a protocol object
using the following methods.
<PRE>
extern HTEventCallback * HTProtocol_client (HTProtocol * protocol);
extern HTEventCallback * HTProtocol_server (HTProtocol * protocol);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Is Access Scheme Preemptive
</H3>
<P>
Returns YES if the implementation of the access scheme supports preemptive
access only.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_preemptive (HTProtocol * protocol);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Binding to the Transport Class
</H3>
<P>
An application protocol is registered together with a
<A HREF="HTTrans.html">transport protocol </A>in order to communicate with
the thansport layer.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_setTransport (HTProtocol * protoccol,
				     const char * transport);
extern const char * HTProtocol_transport (HTProtocol * protocol);
