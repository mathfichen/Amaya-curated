   This module provides an event registry and a multi-threaded event loop. An application
   may use this module for:
   
      event loop and registry - Application registers HTEvntrg_register and
      HTEvntrg_unregister and calls HTEventrg_loop to dispatch events as they occur.
      
      event registry - Application just registers its own event handlers and chains them
      to HTEvntrg_register and HTEvntrg_unregister. When the application's event loop gets
      activity on a socket, it calls HTEvent_dispatch to handle it.
      
      nothing - Application registers its own event handler uses its own event loop to
      dispatch those events.
      
   This module is implemented by HTEvntrg.c, and it is a part of the W3C Reference
   Library.

EVENT REAGISTRY

   single HTEventCallback function for all operations. and the priority field is ignored.
