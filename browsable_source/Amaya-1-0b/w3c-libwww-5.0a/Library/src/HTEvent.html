The Event Class defines any event manager to be used by libwww for handling
events. An <I>event</I> is not strictly defined as it is highly platform
dependent and hence out of scope for the Library. If you are using the libwww
pseudo threads on Unix then an event is when the&nbsp;<I>select()</I> system
call returns a notification on&nbsp;a socket descriptor, but it may as well
be an asynchronous event from the windows manager etc. If your application
is not using anything but traditional blocking sockets then you do not need
an event manager at all. In that case, libwww will block on any socket or
system call until the process can proceed.
<P>
The libwww interface to an event manager is very simple as it consists of
<B>registering</B> a <I>socket descriptor</I>, the <I>location</I> in the
program, and the <I>current state</I> when an operation (for example
<CODE>read</CODE>) would block. When the event manager at a later point in
time gets a notification that the socket has become ready, it can then call
libwww with the state saved from the registration and libwww can continue.
Second, libwww must be able to <B>unregister</B> a socket when it is not
anymore in a state where it can block. <I>Only</I> in case the application
wishes to use <I>non-blocking</I> sockets it should register methods for
handling the <B>registration</B> process as described below.
<P>
<B>Note</B>: The library <B>core</B> does <I>not</I> define any event manager
- it is considered part of the application. The library comes with a
<A HREF="HTEvntrg.html">default event manager</A> which can be initiated
using the function <CODE>HTEventInit()</CODE> in <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit
module</A>
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTEvent.c">HTEvent.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">W3C Reference
Library</A>.

  <A NAME="eventHandlers">Event Handlers</A>
</H2>
<P>
A <I>location</I> is a function that can be registered by the event manager
and called at a later point in time in order to continue an operation. All
locations must be of type &nbsp;<CODE>HTEventCallback</CODE> as defined here:
<PRE>
typedef int HTEventCallback (SOCKET, HTRequest *, SockOps);
</PRE>
<P>
There are many default event handlers provided with the Library. For example,
all the protocol modules such as the <A HREF="HTTP.html">HTTP client module</A>
are implemented as event handlers. In stead of using blocking sockets, this
allows a protocol module to register itself when performing an operation
that would block. When the sockets becomes ready the handler is called with
th socket in question, the request object, and the socket operation &nbsp;

  Registering and Unregistering Event Handlers
</H2>
<P>
As mentioned above, the only interface libwww requires from an event manager
is a method to <I>register</I> an event handler when an operation would block
and <I>unregister</I> it when the operation has completed The library registers
and unregisters event handlers by calling the following two functions:
<PRE>extern int HTEvent_register	(SOCKET, HTRequest *,
				 SockOps, HTEventCallback *,
				 HTPriority);
extern int HTEvent_unregister	(SOCKET, SockOps);
</PRE>
<P>
The register function contains information about which socket we are waiting
on to get ready and which operation we are waiting for (read, write, etc.),
the request object containing the current request, the event handler that
we want to be called when the socket becomes reasy, and finally the priority
by which we want the thread to be processed by the event manager. Likewise,
libwww can unregister a operation on a socket which means that libwww is
no longer waiting for this actiion to become ready.
<H2>
  Registering an Event Manager
</H2>
<P>
The Library core does not contain any event manager as it depends on whether
you want to use pseudo threads no threads, or real threads. Instead, libwww
comes with a <A HREF="HTEvntrg.html">default implementation</A> that you
may register, but you may as well implement and register your own. The register
and unregister functions above actually does nothing than looking for a
registered event manager and then passes the call on to that. You register
your own event manager by using the methods below:
<PRE>
typedef int HTEvent_registerCallback(SOCKET, HTRequest *,
				     SockOps, HTEventCallback *,
				     HTPriority);
typedef int HTEvent_unregisterCallback(SOCKET, SockOps);

extern void HTEvent_setRegisterCallback(HTEvent_registerCallback *);
extern void HTEvent_setUnregisterCallback(HTEvent_unregisterCallback *);
</PRE>
<P>
You can register the event manager provided together with libwww by using
the <CODE>HTEventInit()</CODE> in the <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit module</A>
