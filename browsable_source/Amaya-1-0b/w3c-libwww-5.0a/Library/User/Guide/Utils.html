<H1>Utilities</H1>

This document covers the basic programming utilities that can be used
in the client or server to make life easier.

<H2>Container Modules</H2>

These modules are generic data object storage modules that might be
used wherever convenient. The general rule for freeing memory from
these modules is that free methods handles data object generated
within the modules whereas user data is for the caller to free. The
modules consist of:<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="z59" HREF="../../src/HTBTree.html">Binary Trees</A>
<DD>This is a complete balanced binary tree that might be used for storage
and sort of a large number of data objects, e.g. filenames in directory
listings etc.

<DT><A NAME="z50" HREF="../../src/HTChunk.html">Dynamic Strings</A>
<DD>A Chunk is a block wise expandable array of type (char *) and is a sort of
apology for real strings in C. Chunks make it easier to handle dynamic strings
of unknown size. It is often faster than using the String Copy Routines</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z77" HREF="../../src/HTList.html">Linked Lists</A>
<DD>This module provides the functionality for managing a generic list of data
objects. The module is implemented as a single linked list using the scheme
<EM>first in - last out (FILO)</EM>.

<DT><A HREF="../../src/HTAssoc.html">Association Lists</A>
<DD>This is a small module build on top of HTList that provides a way to
store <EM>Name-Value</EM> pairs in an easy way.

<DT><A HREF="../../src/HTString.html">Strings</A>

<DD>Routines for dynamic arrays of characters include string copy,
case insensitive comparison etc. It also contains functions for
generating <B>date and time stamps</B>, <B>MessageID</B> etc.

<DT><A HREF="../../src/HTAtom.html">Atoms</A>
<DD>Atoms are strings which are given representative pointer values so that
they can be stored more efficiently, and comparisons for equality done more
efficiently. The pointer values are in fact entries into a hash table.

</DL>

<H2>Basic Utilities</H2>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution"> Look into these modules
before you start defining system dependent stuff. Most things are
already defined here! The list of basic utility modules are currently
as follows

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="../../src/sysdep.html">System specifics</A>
<DD>The <A HREF="../../src/sysdep.html">sysdep.h</A> file
includes system-specific include files and flags for I/O to network
and disk. The only reason for this file is that the Internet world is
more complicated than Posix and ANSI.

<DT><A HREF="../../src/HTUtils.html">Platform Independent macros</A>
<DD>The <A HREF="../../src/HTUtils.html">HTUtil.h</A>
include file contains things we need everywhere, generally macros for
declarations, booleans, etc.
