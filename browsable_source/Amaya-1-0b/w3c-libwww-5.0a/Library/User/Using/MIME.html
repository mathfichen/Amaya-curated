  Protocol Headers and Extensions
</H1>
<P>
The Library provides a few powerful mechanisms to handle document metainformation
and how to generate and parse additional header information coming across
the network. This section describes how to handle metainformation and headers
and how this can be used to experiment with existing protocols by means of
additional headers. Headers are registered in a
<A HREF="Response.html">Response Object</A> but are not parsed until they
are needed. If we want to cache the object then the headers are moved to
an <A HREF="../../src/HTAnchor.html">HTAnchor Object</A> but the headers
are still not parsed before we need to.
<H2>
  Generating Headers
</H2>
<P>
Outgoing metainformation describing preferences in requests or entities to
be sent to a remote server is handled in two ways: The Library supports a
"native" set (called <EM>known</EM> headers of headers which can be manipulated
directly, but it also provides support for header extensions defined by the
application. This section describes how both the existing set of headers
and the extensions can be handled.
<H3>
  Generating Known Headers
</H3>
<P>
The Library manages a "native" set of protocol headers which we will introduce
in this section. The default behavior for the Library is to use a representative
set of headers on each request but all headers can be explicitly enabled
or disabled on a per request basic by the application. Here we will mainly
describe the set of native headers but leave the description of how to manipulate
them for the section on managing <A HREF="Request.html">Request objects</A>.
The native set of headers fall into the following three categories:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <I>General Headers</I>
  <DD>
    There are a few header fields which have general applicability for both request
    and response messages, but which do not apply to the communication parties
    or the entity being transferred. This mask enables and disables these headers.
    If the bit is not turned on they are not sent. All headers are optional and
    the default value is not to use any of these headers at all.
  <DT>
    <I>Request Headers</I>
  <DD>
    The request header fields allow the client to pass additional information
    about the request (and about the client itself) to the server. All headers
    are optional but the default behavior is to use all request headers
    <EM>except</EM> <CODE>From</CODE> and <CODE>Pragma</CODE>. The reason is
    that the former in general requires permission by the user and the latter
    has special meanings for proxy servers.
  <DT>
    <I>Entity Headers</I>
  <DD>
    The entity headers contain information about the object sent in the HTTP
    transaction. This flag defines which headers are to be sent in a request
    together with an entity body. All headers are optional but the default value
    is to use as many as possible.
</DL>
<P>
As mentioned, the set of native headers are equivalent to the set of header
defined by the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.1 protocol</A> specification.
Libwww also provides functionality for registering additional headers which
we will have a look at in the next section.
<H3>
  Generating Extension Headers
</H3>
<P>
Each time a request is to be generated, the Library looks to see if a list
of callback functions has been registered to provide additional metainformation
to send along with the request. If this is the case then each of these callback
functions will be called in turn and the resulting request is then the sum
of the original response and the information provided by the callback functions.

<H2>
  Parsing Headers
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="../../src/HTMIME.html">MIME parser stream</A> parses MIME
metainformation, for example generated by MIME-like protocols, such as HTTP,
and NNTP. For <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> it handles all headers
as defined in HTTP/1.1 of the specification. When a header is parsed, the
information is first stored in an <A HREF="Response.html">HTResponse
object.</A> 
<H3>
  Parsing Known Headers
</H3>
<P>
The set of headers directly handled by the
<A HREF="../../src/HTMIME.html">internal MIME parser</A> is the reader is
referred to the actual implementation in order to see the exact list. However,
some of the more special headers are:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>Allow</CODE>
  <DD>
    Builds a list of allowed methods for this entity
  <DT>
    <CODE>Content-Language</CODE>
  <DD>
    Builds a list of natural languages
  <DT>
    <CODE>Content-Length</CODE>
  <DD>
    This parameter is now passed
  <DT>
    <CODE>Content-Type</CODE>
  <DD>
    The <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> header now support the <CODE>charset</CODE>
    parameter and the <CODE>level</CODE> parameter, however none of them are
    used by the <A HREF="#HTML">HTML parser</A>
  <DT>
    <CODE>Date</CODE>, <CODE>Expires</CODE>, <CODE>Retry-After</CODE>, and
    <CODE>LastModified</CODE>
  <DD>
    All date and time headers are parsed understanding the following formats:
    RFC 1123, RFC 850, ANSI C's asctime(), and delta time. The latter is a
    non-negative integer indicating seconds after the message was received. Note,
    that it is <EM>always</EM> for the application to issue a new request as
    a function of any of the date and time headers..
  <DT>
    <CODE>DerivedFrom, Version</CODE>
  <DD>
    For handling version control when managing collaborative works using HTTP.
</DL>
<H3>
  Parsing Extension Headers
</H3>
<P>
In many cases, if you have registered an extra set of headers to be generated,
you are also in a situation where you would like to handle the result that
is returned by the remote server. As we will describe in this section, the
Library provides a very similar interface to the one presented above for
generating extra headers.
<P>
Each time a request is received, and a unknown header is encountered by the
internal <A HREF="../../src/HTMIME.html">MIME parser</A>, libwww looks to
see if a list of callback functions has been registered to parse additional
metainformation. In case a parser is found for this particular header, the
call back is called with the header and all parameters that might follow
it. As MIME headers can contain line wrappings, the
<A HREF="../../src/HTMIME.html">MIME parser</A> canonicalizes the header
line before the callback function is called which makes the job easier for
the callback function.
