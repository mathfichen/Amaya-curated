  Getting Started
</H1>
<P>
This guide assumes that you have already compiled the Library and are ready
to use it building an application. If this is not the case then please read
the <A HREF="../../../INSTALL.html">Installation guide</A> before you continue
reading this document. One thing to note is that as new versions of the Library
are released frequently, it is recommended that you verify that the version
is up to date. You can compare your version of the code with the current
version which is available from the online documentation from our WWW server.
<P>
The Library functionality is divided into a set of <I>interfaces</I> defined
by each their own include file. They all have a name starting with
<EM>WWW</EM>, and as they will be referenced throughout this guide, we might
as well introduce the two basic ones from the beginning. The rest are explained
in detail in <A HREF="../Guide/Overview.html">Library Interfaces</A>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../../src/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil</A>
  <DD>
    The WWW Utility module contains a lot of the functionality that makes it
    possible to make applications, that is container modules for data objects,
    basic string functionality etc. This module is the basis for all of the following
    modules and is used extensively.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore</A>
  <DD>
    The WWW Core module is a set of registration modules that glues an application
    together. It contains no real functionality in itself; it is for example
    not capable of loading a HTML document. It only provides a large set of hooks
    which can be used to add functionality to the Library and to give an application
    real life. We will here a lot more to the structure of the core, and much
    of this guide is actually describing how to add functionality to the core.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../../src/WWWLib.html">WWWLib</A>
  <DD>
    This include is the main include file for the Library. It basically consists
    of the <A HREF="../../src/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil</A> and the
    <A HREF="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore</A> so that the application only
    needs to include this one instead of two.
</DL>
<P>
As mentioned, in order to use the core public functions of the Library, your
application needs to include the file <A HREF="../../src/WWWLib.html">WWWLib
interface</A>. This file is a container for all the Library include files
that together define the public API of the core of the Library. As described
in the document <A HREF="../Architecture/">Library Architecture</A> the core
is a frame work for other modules that provide the actual functionality,
for example for parsing HTML documents or getting a document via HTTP or
FTP. We will explain later how this functionality can be enabled and used
by an application.
<P>
The application must explicitly initialize the Library before it can start
using it so that the internal file descriptors, and variables can be set
to their respective values. This only has to be done once while the application
is running and is typically done when the application is started. The application
also should close down the Library when it has stopped using it - typically
when the application is closing down. The Library will then return resources
like file descriptors and dynamic memory to the operating system. In practice
the initialization and termination is done using the following two functions:
<PRE>
BOOL HTLibInit(const char * AppName, const char * AppVersion)
</PRE>
<P>
This function initializes memory, file descriptors, and interrupt handlers
etc. By default it also calls initialization functions for all the dynamic
modules in the Library. The dynamic modules are described in
"<A HREF="../Architecture/DesignModel.html">Libwww Architecture</A>". A major
part of the User's Guide is devoted to describing how the Library can be
configured, both at run time and at compile time, and the dynamic modules
are an important part of the Library configuration.
<P>
The two arguments to the function are the name of the application and the
version number respectively. It is not a requirement that these values are
unique and they can both be the empty string (""). However, as the strings
are used in the <A HREF="../../src/HTTP.html/">HTTP protocol module</A> when
communicating with other WWW applications it is strongly recommended that
the values are chosen carefully according to the
<A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP specifications</A>. The most important
requirement is to use normal ASCII characters without any form for space
as we will see in the example below.
<PRE>
BOOL HTLibTerminate()
</PRE>
<P>
This function cleans up the memory, closes open file descriptors, and returns
all resources to the operating system. It is essential that
<CODE>HTLibInit(...)</CODE> is the first call to the Library and
<CODE>HTLibTerminate()</CODE> is the last as the behavior otherwise is undefined.
<H2>
  Building your first Application
</H2>
<P>
We have now explained the first few steps in how to initialize the core of
the Library. We can now write our first minimal application which will do
absolutely nothing but initializing and terminating the Library. In the example
we assume that the compiler knows where to look for the Library include file
<CODE>WWWLib.h</CODE> and also knows where to find the binary library, often
called <CODE>libwww.a</CODE> on Unix platforms and <CODE>libwww.lib</CODE>
on Windows. Again, the result might depend on the setup of the dynamic modules,
but if no dynamic modules are enabled then the example will generate an
executable file. If you are in doubt about how to set your compiler then
you can often get some good ideas by looking into the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>.
<P>
PS: You can find the examples directly in form of C files in our
<A HREF="../../Examples/">example area</A>
<PRE>
#include "WWWLib.h"
int main()
{
    HTLibInit("TestApp", "1.0");
    HTLibTerminate();
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Some platforms require a socket library when building network applications.
This is for example the case when building on Macintosh or Windows machines.
The Library uses the
<A HREF="http://err.ethz.ch/members/neeri/macintosh/gusiman/GUSI.html">GUSI
socket</A> library on the Macintosh and the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.spry.com/ms-windows/winsock/docs/winsock.txt">WinSock
library</A> on windows platforms. Please check the documentation on these
libraries for how to install them and also if there are any specific requirements
on your platform when building network applications.
<P>
<H2>
  Adding Functionality
</H2>
<P>
The core parts of the Library can be thought of as a framework with hooks
for adding functionality depending on what the applications needs. The core
can not do anything on its own but when hooking in modules, the Library suddenly
can start doing useful stuff. In the Library distribution file there is already
a large set of specific protocol modules and stream modules for handling
many common Internet protocols and data formats. We will explain protocol
modules and streams in much more detail later, but for the moment it is
sufficient to know that protocol modules knows how to communicate with remote
servers on the Internet and that streams are used to pass documents back
and forth between the Internet and the application with the Library as an
intermediary part.
<P>
While the previous application wasn't capable of doing anything we will now
add functionality so that we can request a URL from a remote Web server and
save the result to a file. To do this we need to register two additional
modules after initializing the Library: A protocol module that handles HTTP
and a stream that can save data to a local file. Both these modules are already
in the distribution file and in this example we show how to enable them.
It is also possible to write your own versions of these modules and then
register them instead of the ones provided with the Library. This makes no
difference to the core part of the Library and is an example of how the
functionality can be extended or changed by adding new modules as needed.
<P>
<PRE>
#include "WWWLib.h"
#include "HTTP.h"

int main()
{
    HTList *converters = HTList_new();		     /* Create a list object */

    /* Initialize the Library */
    HTLibInit("TestApp", "1.0");

    /* Register the HTTP Module */
    HTProtocol_add("http", YES, HTLoadHTTP, NULL);

    /* Add a conversion to our empty list */
    HTConversion_add(converters, "*/*", "www/present", HTSaveLocally, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);

    /* Register our list with one conversion */
    HTFormat_setConversion(converters);

    /* Delete the list with one conversion */
    HTConversion_deleteAll(converters);

    /* Terminate the Library */
    HTLibTerminate();
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>
The two new things in this example is that we now have two registration
functions. We will explain more about these functions as we go along; for
now we will only introduce the functions and their arguments. The interesting
part about the two registration functions is that they represent the two
ways of registration in the Library: Some things are registered directly
like the protocol module and other things are registered as lists of objects
like the list of converters. The reason for this is to make the registration
process easier for the application to handle; protocol modules are often
initialized only once while the application is running. Therefore it is easier
to register them directly. As we will see later in this guide, converters,
however, can be enabled and disabled depending on a regular basis depending
on what the application is trying to do. It is therefore easier to keep the
converters in lists so that they can be enabled and disabled in batch.
<P>
Now, let's take a closer look at the two registration functions. The first
registers the HTTP protocol module which enables the Library of accessing
documents using HTTP from any server on the Internet.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProtocol_add (const char *       	name,
			    BOOL		preemptive,
			    HTEventCallBack *	callback);
</PRE>
<P>
The first argument is a name equivalent to the scheme part in a URL, for
example <B>http</B>://www.w3.org, where <B>http</B> is the scheme part. When
a request is issued to the Library using a URL, it looks at the URL scheme
and sees if it knows how to handle it. If not then an error is issued. The
second argument describes whether the protocol module supports non-blocking
sockets or not. This is a decision to be made when the module is first designed
and can normally not be changed. In the example we register HTTP for using
blocking sockets, but all native Library protocol modules including HTTP,
FTP, News, Gopher, and access to the local file system supports non-blocking
sockets. The third argument is the name of the protocol function to be called
when the Library is about to hand off the request to the module.
<P>
<PRE>
extern void HTConversion_add   (HTList *	conversions,
				const char * 	rep_in,
				const char * 	rep_out,
				HTConverter *	converter,
				double		quality,
				double		secs, 
				double		secs_per_byte);
</PRE>
<P>
This function has many arguments and we will not go into details at this
point. The important thing to note is that we build a list of converters.
Each call to the <CODE>HTConversion_add</CODE> creates a new converter object
and adds it to the list. A converter object is described by an input format
(<CODE>rep_in</CODE>), an output format (<CODE>rep_out</CODE>), the function
name of the converter, and a quality factor describing how good the conversion
is. The last two arguments are currently not used but are reserved for future
use. The quality factor later where we will see how it can be used to distinguish
between multiple conversions in order to pick the best one.
<P>
Even though we now have initialized a protocol module and a converter, the
program example is still not actively doing anything. It only starts the
Library, registers two modules and then terminates the Library again. Our
third and last example in this section does the same amount of initialization
but does also issue a request to the Library for fetching a URL.
<H2>
  Fetching a URL
</H2>
<P>
We now want to create an example which is capable of issuing a request to
the Library to fetch a URL. When doing this we must create a request object
that contains all information that is necessary in order to handle the request.
Then we pass this object to the Library and if the request is valid and the
document does exist we get the data back. In the example we read the URL
to fetch from the command line. As in the other examples we are not too worried
about error checking and error messaging. In a real application you must
of course do this, but here we want to keep the examples simple.
<PRE>
#include "WWWLib.h"
#include "HTTP.h"
#include "HTDialog.h"

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
    HTList * converters = HTList_new();
    HTRequest * request = HTRequest_new();	  /* Create a request object */
    WWWTRACE = SHOW_ALL_TRACE;
    HTLibInit("TestApp", "1.0");
    HTProtocol_add("http", YES, HTLoadHTTP, NULL);
    HTConversion_add(converters, "*/*", "www/present", HTSaveLocally, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    HTFormat_setConversion(converters);
    HTAlert_add(HTPrompt, HT_A_PROMPT);
    if (argc == 2) {
	HTLoadAbsolute(argv[1], request);
    } else
	printf("Type the URL to fetch\n");
    HTRequest_delete(request);			/* Delete the request object */
    HTConversion_deleteAll(converters);
    HTLibTerminate();
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>
When this program is run, it will take the argument and call the Library
to fetch it. As we haven't given any name for the file which we are creating
on our local disk, the Library will prompt the user for a file name. Automatic
redirection and access authentication is handled by the HTTP module but might
require the user to type in a user name and a password. An example on how
to run this program is:
<PRE>
./fetch_url http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/
</PRE>
<P>
The results stored in the file contains the whole message returned by the
remote HTTP server except for the status line. This means that if we ask
a HTTP/1.0 compliant server then we receive a header and a body where the
header contains metainformation about the object, for example content type,
content language etc. We shall later see how the MIME parser stream can strip
out the header information so that we end up with the body of the response
message.
<P>
In the next chapters we shall see that protocol modules and converters only
is a part of what can be registered in the Library and that the application
can specify many other types of preferences and capabilities.
