  Building libwww for Windows
</H1>
<P>
When building the W3C Reference Library on a Windows platform (Windows 3.1
(32 bit), Windows 95, or Windows NT), you can decide on a set of different
options to be enabled or disabled. This document describes the set of DLLs
and how they can be built. C compilers on Windows platforms often have a
notion of <EM>projects</EM> that define what files to include in the compilation
and where to put the output. This document does not describe the process
of creating projects as it depends on the compiler that you are using but
refers you to your C compiler manuals.

  <A NAME="select">Interleaved vs Asynchronous Sockets</A>
</H2>
<P>
Non-blocking network access can either be done using multiplexed I/O or
asynchronous I/O. Multiplexed I/O is based on an event loop with a
<CODE>select()</CODE> system call. The <CODE>select()</CODE> system call
is a function that scans a set of BSD like socket descriptors and returns
when one or more sockets are ready for either network <B>read</B> or
<B>write</B>. Asynchronous I/O is based on signals instead of a
<CODE>select()</CODE> call. Each time a socket is ready for a network operation,
for example <B>read</B>, a signal is generated. This signal can then be caught
by the application in an signal handler. Using the <CODE>select()</CODE>
call is called <EM>reactive</EM> whereas using signals is called
<EM>pro-active</EM>.
<P>
The W3C Reference Library supports both approaches under Windows, and therefore
you must choose which model you prefer. The choice can depend on what type
of application you are using and what other libraries you are using.

<H3>
  <A NAME="unix">Interleaved I/O Using select()</A>
</H3>
<P>
In this mode the <A HREF="../../src/HTLoop.html">Event Manager</A> registers
all active sockets and passes them to a <CODE>select()</CODE> call which
then processes the registered sockets. When <CODE>select()</CODE> returns
the Event Manager dispatches the appropriate handlers as the sockets get
ready.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <B>What to do:</B> <EM>Undefine</EM>

this flag. <A NAME="async"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="async">Asynchronous I/O based using Signals</A>
</H3>
<P>
Here the <A HREF="../../src/HTLoop.html">Event Manager</A> registers all
active sockets using <CODE>WSAAsyncSelect</CODE> which is part of the WinSock
API. When <CODE>AsyncSelect()</CODE> which is the asynchronous equivalent
to the <CODE>select()</CODE> returns, the Event Manager dispatches the results
of the <CODE>AsyncSelect()</CODE>. As the asynchronous select call needs
a windows handle, the Library creates a <EM>hidden window</EM>. This window
is <EM>not</EM> to be used explicitly by the application and the Library
closes the window when exiting.
<P>

<P>
A Windows application can use either a character based command line interface,
or a graphic windows interface. Many MS-DOS applications do run as a simple
command line tool which doesn't use GUI at all. Under Win32, there is a notion
of a <A HREF="#console">console</A> application. This means that all user
interaction happens through a standard DOS shell interface, with a FILE pointer
like that in Unix. This does not exist under Win16, where a Windows window
is required.
<P>
The Library supports both the console and the windows interface, and again
you must choose what version you prefer. This is often something you have
to decide as you are creating the project. <A NAME="windowed"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="windowed">Windows Application</A>
</H3>
<P>
If you want to make a windows application then this is the mode to use. Eric
Prud'hommeaux has provided a Windows application wrapper for the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/">W3C Line Mode Browser</A> which you can use
in order to build the browser as a Windows application. This is found in
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/windows/www.c">www.c</A>. Three other modules,
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/windows/scroll.c">scroll.c</A> and
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/windows/lib.c">lib.c</A> provide the window
for the application.

The console option is available only in Win32 in which case all user interaction
happens through the Win32 console window. This model strongly resembles a
Unix vt100 terminal interface.

  <A NAME="lib">Static vs Dynamic Libraries</A>
</H2>
<P>
Windows has a concept of both static and dynamic libraries, the latter also
known as <EM>DLLs</EM>. It is out of scope here to describe the difference
between DLLs and static libraries, but as DLLs is based on a lot more flexible
memory model it is almost always the best solution for Windows applications.
<P>
The W3C Reference Library support both models in that if can be built as
either one big static library or as a set of small DLLs. As mentioned, it
is in almost all cases recommended to build DLLs instead of static libraries,
and on Win16 it is required because a static library is too big.
<A NAME="static"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="static">Static Library</A>
</H3>
<P>
The libraries may be build as one large static library. This is how libwww
is implemented on Unix platforms. Subsequent references to the various DLLs
may all be assumed to refer to the staticly linked libwww. Care has been
taken to insure that there are no <CODE>#define</CODE> conflicts where one
library would want a <CODE>#define</CODE> that would interfere with the modules
in other libraries. When building a static library, see the following sections
on <A HREF="#select">Select Options</A> and <A HREF="#io">Input/Output
Options</A>, accumulate all the <CODE>#defines</CODE> that are required,
and build the whole libwww with those <CODE>#defines</CODE>.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <B>What to do:</B> <EM>Undefine</EM>
<B>WWW_WIN_DLL</B> as preprocessor directives when generating the project
for the Library. Please note, that it is not recommended to staticly link
to the libraries if you are building a Win16 application as it creates segment
size problems. <A NAME="dynamic"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (DLLs)</A>
</H3>
<P>
The libwww can also be built as a set of DLLs that follows the modular
architecture of the Library. This enables the application programmer to choose
exactly what functionality should be enabled in the application. The boundaries
between these DLLs are based on module interdependency and some assumptions
regarding which modules may be replaced by the application. Unlike static
linking, dynamic linking requires that all the modules in a DLL be replaced
at once. This is because the DLL needs all internal references to be resolved
at build time.

<H3>
  Special Windows DLL
</H3>
<P>
In addition to platform independent modules, there is a small Windows specific
DLL which implements the trace message generation. The DLL is called
<CODE>windll.dll</CODE> and contains also the definition of the global trace
flag definition.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <CODE>windll.c</CODE> - <CODE>DLLMain</CODE> to <CODE>all</CODE> DLLs.
  <LI>
    <CODE>wwwdll.c</CODE> - instances of PTTYPrint and
    <CODE>WWW_TraceFlag</CODE>. This is included in wwwdll so that it can export
    the variables to the rest of the DLLs.
  <LI>
    <CODE>wwwdll.def</CODE>, <CODE>wwwutils.def</CODE>, <CODE>wwwcore.def</CODE>
    - def (exports) files for the DLLs of the same names.
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <B>What to do:</B> Include the windll.dll
as a part of your project and make sure that it is built as the first DLL.
<H3>
  Exporting Functions from DLLs
</H3>
<P>
The functions exported from a DLL are listed in the <CODE>EXPORTS</CODE>
section of a <CODE>.def</CODE> file. These can be found in the
<A HREF="../../src/windows">windows</A> directory. These may also be build
by the <A HREF="../../../config/makedefs.pl">makeDefs.pl</A> perl script,
see the description below. You can use the def files as a basis for generating
the DLL projects for your compiler.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <B>What to do:</B> Generate the DLLs
according to the def files so the exported interface is identical to the
set of functions defined in the actual c files included in the DLL.
<H2>
  Make Files and Projects
</H2>
<P>
Unfortunately, make files are not easily shared among different C compilers
on Windows which complicates the distribution. We can not support all of
them but we can give some hints which may help you to get going.
<H3>
  Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0
</H3>
<P>
In the distribution file you can find a complete
<A HREF="../../src/windows/libwww.mak">Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 Project</A>
that builds the W3C Reference Library as a set of DLLs as described in the
<A HREF="../../User/Guide/">Library Internals</A>. The easiest way to build
the Library is to open the following make files in MSVC and then build then:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="../../src/windows/libwww.mak">libwww make file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="../../../PICS-client/src/windows/pics.mak">PICS library make file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/windows/www.mak">Line Mode browser make file</A>
</OL>
<H3>
  Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0
</H3>
<P>
We do not support this version anymore. Please refer to the precompiled DLLs
if you are going to use this version.
<H3>
  Microsoft Visual C++ 1.x
</H3>
<P>
A problem with the MSVC 1.5 compiler is that it doesn't get the dependencies
right. It includes all <CODE>#include</CODE> directives even tough that some
of these directives are for Unix only and the include files don't exist on
windows. The only way to get around this is to manually edit the project
make files generated by MSVC 1.x and take out the dependencies of files that
are not intended for the Windows platform. Compiling on a 16 bit platform
may also cause some trouble as we don't really support that.
<H3>
  Borland C Compiler
</H3>
<P>
The Borland C compiler has a different DLL interface where you need to use
the reserved word <CODE>export</CODE> in front of all methods and data objects
to be exported from a DLL. This is not currently the case but you can use
the <A HREF="../../../config/makexprt.pl">makexprt.pl</A> Perl script to
change the Library code.
<H3>
  Other Compilers
</H3>
<P>
You can often use this project as the basis for porting the make file. The
DLL description also various from compiler to compiler which can cause that
you can't use the DLL def files directly. We try to make as generic solutions
as possible but have limited resources to provide projects for multiple
compilers. <A NAME="makedefs"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="makedefs">makeDefs.pl</A>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="../../../config/makedefs.pl">makeDefs.pl</A> is a perl 4 script
which takes a list of modules and generates a list of exports used by the
Windows DLLs. The module list may be taken from the appropriate header file
for the library, e.g. <CODE>wwwutils.dll</CODE> uses
<CODE>wwwutils.def</CODE> which is made from <CODE>WWWUtils.html</CODE>.
All def files included in the Library distribution file are automatically
kept up to date by using this script.
