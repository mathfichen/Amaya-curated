The java app server (start module via socket) will be the very next.
This, eventually, will let the "run" menu item re-appear in the CUBrowser
---
java.awt compatibility has not been tested thoroughly. MenuItems / hotkeys
in particular are not compatible yet (within handleEvent() re-implementations,
you can't map an ACTION event by comparing MenuItem objects, you have to rely
on the MenuItem text argument to check for a certain command - but this
should be the standard case anyway).  
---
Hotkey / MenuItem handling will be restructured in a more JDK 1.1
compliant way

The biss.awt.kernel native layer doesn't shrink requested Frame sizes by
the window manager decoration extends. This means a "resize( 200, 200)"
will yield a client area of this size (located within a toplevel window).

jpeg image files are not yet handled by the biss.awt.kernel package
(but interlaced GIFs now whould work)
