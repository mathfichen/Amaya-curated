<p><strong>Amaya</strong> is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as
an authoring tool. It has been designed with the primary purpose of
demonstrating new Web technologies in a WYSIWYG environment. The current
version implements HTML, XHTML, MathML, CSS, and HTTP.</p>

<h3>Main Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>With Amaya, you can manipulate rich Web pages containing forms, tables
    and the most advanced features from HTML. You can create and edit complex
    mathematical expressions within Web pages. You can style your documents
    using Cascading Style Sheets. You can publish HTML and XHTML documents on
    local or remote servers with the HTTP Put method.</li>
  <li>Browsing and authoring are integrated seamlessly. You can browse and
    edit Web pages at the same time. In order to simplify the edition of
    documents, a simple click in Amaya just moves the caret to allow text
    editing; to follow a link, you have to double click. This behavior can be
    changed as well as many other parameters using a preferences menu.</li>
  <li>A  Source view allows you to see the current markup provided by Amaya.
    By this way the user can alternatively edit the HTML form and the source
    code.</li>
  <li>Amaya supports the editing and publishing of CSS style sheets. In
    addition, you can easily link and unlink Cascading Style Sheets to
    documents. It's also possible to selectively enable and disable them and
    see the rendering differences immediately.</li>
  <li>Amaya provides a multi-level multi-document Undo/Redo.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Online Manual</h3>

<p>A User's Manual is available online. You can browse it with the Help menu,
which displays each section separately.  You can also print it: just follow
the <a href="../doc/amaya/Manual.html">Online Manual</a> link below. You'll
get the front page. Then build the whole book with the "Make book" entry from
the Special menu and print the result.</p>
