<h2><a name="L1023">Style Sheets</a></h2>

<p>The <strong>Style</strong> menu allows you to change the appearance of your
documents by two different means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</li>
  <li>using HTML elements and attributes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu are dedicated to CSS,
the last two entries to <a href="#L1371">HTML elements</a>.</p>

<h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>

<h4>Creating and updating style attributes</h4>

<p>Each of the first four entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu call a
dialog box that allows associating a <code>style</code> attribute with the
currently selected elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Character Style</strong> allows choosing the font family, the
    character style, the body size and the underline style.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors</strong> allows choosing the foreground and background
    colors from a palette. Click on a palette cell with the left button to set
    the foreground color, click with the middle button to set the background
    color.</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong> allows setting  alignment, indentation,
    justification and linespacing.</li>
  <li><strong>Background Image</strong> allows choosing a background image and
    its repeat mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all these dialog boxes, <strong>Default</strong> buttons allow you to
remove the corresponding style information from the selected elements.</p>

<p>All modifications made with these dialog boxes can be viewed immediately in
both the Formatted view and the Structure view.</p>

<h4>Changing Width and Height of elements</h4>

<p>The width and height of any element in a document can be changed
interactively, in the same way as <a href="ImageMaps.html#L1171">image map
areas</a>. By pressing the Control key on the keyboard and the middle button
of the mouse, you can resize the box associated with the element under the
cursor. When you release the mouse button, the element size is changed and a
<code>style</code> attribute is associated with the element.</p>

<p>When the resized element is an image, this image is zoomed to fill its new
box.</p>

<h4>Creating, updating and using classes</h4>

<p>When a <code>style</code> attribute has been associated with an element,
you can use that element as a model for creating or modifying a style rule.
Select this element (you must select only one element and this element must
have a <code>style</code> attribute) and choose <strong>Create Rule</strong>
from the <strong>Style</strong> menu. A dialog box pops up that displays a
list of CSS selectors. This list comprises all classes that are defined for
the current document as well as, the element types to which some style is
associated.. Choose a selector in this list or enter a new class name or type
name  and press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. The style of the selected
element is then associated with the chosen selector and the <code>style</code>
attribute is removed from the selected element. Its content is moved to the
<code>STYLE</code> element, in the document <code>HEAD</code>, and all
elements matching the selector are displayed with the new style.</p>

<p>When you have created new classes with the <strong>Create Rule</strong>
command, you can associate these classes with some elements in the document
document. Choose <strong>Apply Class</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
menu. A dialog box pops up which displays all existing classes. Choose one of
these classes. The selected elements are then displayed with the style
associated with the chosen class.</p>

<p>To associate a class with an element, you can also use the <a
href="Attributes.html#L1073"><strong>Attributes</strong> menu</a>. This menu
allows you to delete a class attribute from an element or to change it: the
class attribute is handled like any other attribute.</p>

<h3>Managing external CSS style sheets</h3>

<p>The entry Style Sheets gives access to a set of commands which allows one
to control external and User's preference CSS style sheets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The command <strong>Link</strong> allows one to link a new CSS style
    sheet to the current document. One can click directly the target style
    sheet if it is already displayed in a Amaya window. In other case the user
    should click in the current document to get a dialog box and type the
    target style sheet's URI. This command adds an element link with its
    attributes into the head of the document.</li>
  <li>The command <strong>Open</strong> allows one to open one of the external
    CSS style sheets applied to the current document.</li>
  <li>The command <strong>Disable</strong> allows one to remove effects of one
    of the external CSS style sheets to the current document. This command
    doesn't affect the CSS link in the document.</li>
  <li>The command<strong>Enable</strong> allows one to re-apply effects of one
    of the external CSS style sheets to the current document. This command
    doesn't affect the CSS link in the document.</li>
  <li>The command <strong>Remove</strong> allows one to remove one of the
    external CSS style sheets. This command acts as the Disable command but in
    addition to that the element link which attaches the external CSS style
    sheet is removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commands Open, Disable and Enable can be applied to the User's preference
style sheet, but commands Link and Remove concern only linked CSS style
sheets. The following figure shows the list of CSS style sheets proposed for
the command Open. If no CSS style sheet is currently applied to a document, a
dialog box explains that there is "No CSS file available".</p>

<h3><a name="L1371">Style through HTML elements</a></h3>

<p>HTML provides some character-level elements that allow you to associate
style with character strings. Two entries from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
allow you to handle these HTML elements.</p>

<h4>Creating HTML style elements</h4>

<p>Item <strong>Information type</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
presents a submenu offering a choice of HTML elements that define abstract
styles. Select first a character string in your page and then choose an item
in this menu. The selected character string receives the corresponding style.
Three of these styles are also available through buttons: <em>emphasis</em>
(<img src="../Icons/Em.gif" alt="Emphasis button">), <strong>strong</strong>
(<img src="../Icons/Strong.gif" alt="Strong button">) and <code>code</code>
(<img src="../Icons/Cour.gif" alt="Code button">).</p>

<p>Item <strong>Character elements</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
menu offers another menu for changing the style of text. The first entries of
this menu could be replaced by CSS and should not be used. They are here only
for the sake of completeness of the HTML 3.2 implementation.</p>

<h4>Removing style</h4>

<p>To remove style from a character string, select the string first and
re-apply the command that was used for associating the style you want to
remove. All commands in the submenus <strong>Information Type</strong> and
<strong>Character Element</strong> toggle themselves if re-applied.</p>
