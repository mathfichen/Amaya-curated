<h3><a name="Adding">Adding an image</a></h3>

<p>To insert an image choose <strong>Image</strong> from the
<strong>Types</strong> menu or click on the <img alt="Image " border="0"
src="../Icons/Image.gif" align="middle" longdesc="longdesc.htm"> button (or
use the keyboard shortcut control-t, control-i in Unix). This brings up a
dialog box that lets you enter the file name and <a
href="#Alternative">alternative text</a> ('ALT' text) of the desired image. If
you wish to provide a long description (for example if your image presents
complex information) you should do so in a separate document and link it by
giving the URI as a <strong>longdesc</strong>, also available in the
<strong>Attributes</strong> menu. To help find an image file you can enter a
<strong>filter</strong> field, and use the <strong>filter</strong> button, so
the dialog lists only the files which match your pattern.</p>

<h3><a name="Alternative">Alternative Text and Long Descriptions</a></h3>

<p>For elements such as images (and other multimedia objects) you must provide
alternative text. This will usually be presented instead of the image by a
browser with a voice output system, or a Braille display (used by many people
who are blind). It is also common for users with low-quality connections to
request the alternative view, as text is transmitted much faster than
images.</p>

<p>The alternative text should replace the image in function. For example, if
the image is used to provide an icon linking to a reference point (the first
link on this page, to the W3C 'homepage', is such a link) then the title of
the reference would be a good alternative text.</p>

<p>There are also cases where an image is used for purely visual effect, and
does not add any information value to the page. In this case it is appropriate
to use a blank alternative, although that must still be defined - enter two
double quotes for alternative (eg. alt="").</p>

<p>In cases where the image conveys important information which is not
available from the text of the document you must also provide a description of
the information. The <strong>longdesc</strong> option of the
<strong>Attributes</strong> menu allows you to link a description (which is a
URI - a separate document, or named part of the current document) to the
image.</p>

<p>In order to give an idea of how a page might be presented without the
images, Amaya provides a <strong>Show Alternate</strong> option in the
<strong>Views</strong> menu. If the page were spoken, then the <a
href="Views.html#Alternate">alternate view</a> might simply be read out.
Without useful alternative text for images, many pages become difficult or
impossible to navigate, and users are left 'feeling their way in the
dark'.</p>

<h3><a name="Using">Using client-side image maps</a></h3>

<p><strong>Amaya</strong> allows you to use client-side image maps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To activate an area in a map, double-click on the area with the left
    mouse button. The URI attached to this area is then fetched.</li>
  <li>To display existing areas, choose <strong>Show Map Areas</strong> from
    the <strong>Views</strong> menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Creating">Creating client-side image maps</a></h3>

<p>To create a new image map, you insert an image into the document, and
define areas as links.</p>

<p>To create an area in a image, select the image or an existing area of that
image. Then choose <strong>Rectangle</strong>, <strong>Circle</strong>,
<strong>Polygon</strong> from the <strong>Area Map</strong> submenu of the
<strong>Types</strong> menu, depending on the shape of the new area you want
to create. The <strong>Show map areas</strong> option in the
<strong>Views</strong> menu will outline each of the existing map areas on an
image.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To create a rectangular or circular area, you must first select the
    position of one corner by pressing the left mouse button. Keep the button
    pressed down and move to the position of the opposite corner, then release
    the button. The area is now defined.</li>
  <li>For a Polygon, enter each point by clicking the corresponding position
    with the left mouse button. To indicate the last point, click with the
    middle button.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the area has been defined, you must first provide <a
href="#Alternative">alternative text</a> in the dialogue provided and then
enter the target of the link associated with that area. Just select the target
(or enter its URI if it is not displayed), in the same way as you <a
href="Links.html#L245">create links</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="L11711">Moving image map areas</a></h3>

<p>When the area has been defined, you can move this area:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>By direct manipulation - combining the <strong>Control key</strong>
    with the <strong>Left button</strong> of the mouse within an area of image
    map allows you to move this area.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>By editing the <strong>coords</strong> attribute of the area in the
    Structure View.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="L1171">Resizing image map areas</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>By direct manipulation - combining the <strong>Control key</strong> with
    the <strong>Middle</strong> or the <strong>Right button</strong> of the
    mouse within an area of image map allows you to resize this area.</li>
  <li>By editing the <strong>coords</strong> attribute of the area in the
    Structure View.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
