## SWHAPPE actors.md Template

Here we propose a template for `actors.md` for SWHAPPE.

Each participant of the process should have a corresponding record on the `actors.md` with the structure below.

Please note that:

* Name and Surname of actors should be linked to their paragraph in [actors.md](./actors.md) file;
* Items should be linked to the file [inside the repository](./raw_materials/);
* We recommend to use only one of the following roles for each record: Author, Collector, Curator;
* Current and Historical Affiliation refer to the circumstances when the software were produced and those when the Depository is build, respectively;
* Notes are optional.

Example of Actor link:

[Name Surname](./actors.md#name-surname)

Example of Item link:

[Item Name](./raw_materials/example_file.zip)
