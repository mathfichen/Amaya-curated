## SWHAPPE catalogue.md Template

Here we propose a template for catalogue<span>.md for SWHAPPE.

Each Item in the `raw_materials` and `additional_materials` folders of Workbench should have a corresponding record on the `catalogue.md` with the structure below..

Please note that:
* Name and Surname of actors should be linked to their paragraph in [actors.md](./actors.md) file;
* Items should be linked to the file [inside the raw materials repository](./raw_matherials/) or [inside the additional materials repository](./additional_matherials/);
* On the [second part of the Catalogue](./catalogue.md#SW_NAME-Catalogue-Tree) should be copied the result of the command `tree -a raw_materials additional_materials ` ;
* *Notes:* are optional; they should contains `Additional materials.` for additional materials
* *Warehouse:* is optional - should be used only when a physical warehouse is used to store material taken from the *origin*; .
